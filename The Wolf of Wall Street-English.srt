1
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,010
The world of investing can be a jungle.

2
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,269
Bulls. Bears.

3
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,229
Danger at every turn.

4
00:00:54,763 --> 00:01:00,361
That's why we at Stratton Oakmont
pride ourselves on being the best.

5
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:04,899
Trained professionals to guide you
through the financial wilderness.

6
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,988
Stratton Oakmont.

7
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:08,945
Stability.

8
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,746
Integrity.

9
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,618
Pride.

10
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,039
One!

11
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,835
Two!

12
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,500
Three!

13
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,514
Twenty-five grand to the first
cocksucker to nail a bull's-eye!

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,342
Come on! Let's go!

15
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,011
One!

16
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,516
Two!

17
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,723
Three!

18
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,359
My name is Jordan Belfort.

19
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,651
Not him.

20
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,441
Me. That's right.

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,397
I'm a former member
of the middle class

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,360
raised by two accountants
in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.

23
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,121
The year I turned 26,
as the head of my own brokerage firm,

24
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,824
I made $49 million,

25
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:59,332
which really pissed me off because
it was three shy of a million a week.

26
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,633
No, no, no. My Ferrari was white,

27
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,883
like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.
Not red.

28
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,435
See that humongous estate down there?

29
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,853
That's my house.

30
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,476
For millionaires whose ships...

31
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:22,810
My wife, Naomi,
the Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,

32
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,021
a former mode! And Miller Lite girl.

33
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,151
Yeah.

34
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,779
She was the one with my cock
in her mouth in the Ferrari.

35
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,407
So put your dick back in your pants.

36
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,197
In addition to Naomi
and my two perfect kids,

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,157
I own a mansion, private jet,

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,867
six cars, three horses,

39
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,545
two vacation homes,
and a 170-foot yacht.

40
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,465
Anchors aweigh!

41
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,218
I also gamble like a degenerate.
I drink like a fish.

42
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,096
I fuck hookers maybe
five, six times a week.

43
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,019
I have three different federal agencies
looking to indict me.

44
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,772
Oh, yeah, and I love drugs.

45
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,270
Okay.

46
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,523
- One more round.
- Oh, yeah.

47
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,449
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,130
Pull up. Pull up!
We're gonna crash, for Christ sake!

49
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,457
Relax!

50
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,505
Just relax.

51
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,647
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

52
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,311
Good job.

53
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,985
You get in there safe, all right?

54
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,903
Till the next time, brother.

55
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,526
Till next time.

56
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,368
Yup, on a daily basis
I consume enough drugs

57
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:04,875
to sedate Manhattan,
Long Island and Queens for a month.

58
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,001
Okay, Mr. Jordan.

59
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,668
I take Quaaludes 10 to 15 times a day
for my "back pain,"

60
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,594
Adderall to stay focused,

61
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,597
Xanax to take the edge off,
pot to mellow me out,

62
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,642
cocaine to wake me back up again
and morphine, well,

63
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,181
because it's awesome.

64
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,386
Good morning, Nathan.

65
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,646
But of all the drugs
under God's blue heaven,

66
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,777
there is one that is my absolute favorite.

67
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,367
You see,

68
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,828
enough of this shit'll
make you invincible.

69
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,619
Able to conquer the world,

70
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,826
and eviscerate your enemies.

71
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,964
And I'm not talking about this.

72
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,961
I'm talking about this.

73
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,846
See, money doesn't
just buy you a better life,

74
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,425
better food, better cars, better pussy.

75
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,806
It also makes you a better person.

76
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,480
You can give generously to the church
or political party of your choice.

77
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,684
You can save the fucking
spotted ow! With money.

78
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,695
I always wanted to be rich.
So let me go back.

79
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,076
I'm 22 years old, newly married,

80
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,738
and already a money-crazed little shit.

81
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:21,993
So what do I do?

82
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,417
I go to the one place on Earth
that befit my high-minded ambitions.

83
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,079
I love you.

84
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,722
You are lower than pond scum.

85
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,767
You got a problem with that,

86
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,521
Jordan?

87
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,686
No. No problem at all.

88
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,484
Good. Because that is what you are.

89
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,937
Pond scum.

90
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,271
Your job is connector,

91
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,109
which means that you'll be dialing
the phone over 500 times a day

92
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:01,112
trying to connect me
with wealthy business owners.

93
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,162
And until you pass your Series 7,

94
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,457
that is all you're gonna
fucking be doing. Sit.

95
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,784
Sit!

96
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,209
Now just so you know,
last year I made over $300,000.

97
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:14,883
The other guy you'll be working for,
he made over a million.

98
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,585
A million dollars?

99
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,638
I could only imagine
what a douchebag that guy must be.

100
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,640
- Jordan Belfort.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,384
- Mark Hanna.
- A pleasure to meet you.

102
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,061
And you as well. I see you've
already met the village asshole.

103
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,764
Smile and dial.

104
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,350
And don't pick up
your fucking head until 1:00.

105
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,976
Hey, fuck him.

106
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,687
I'm the senior broker here.
He's just a worthless piker.

107
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,564
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

108
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,992
Now did you really pitch
a stock in your job interview?

109
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,908
I had to do something
to stand out. Right, sir?

110
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,572
I fucking love that.

111
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,783
- Lunch. Today.
- Yeah.

112
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,707
We don't start dialing at 9:30

113
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,671
because our clients
are already answering the phone.

114
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,375
Three. Two. One.

115
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,459
Let's fuck!

116
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,129
You want to know
what money sounds like?

117
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,180
Go to a trading floor on Wall Street.

118
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,724
"Fuck" this, "Shit" that.

119
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,346
"Cunt," "cock," "asshole."

120
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,587
I couldn't believe
how these guys talked to each other.

121
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,892
- Good fucking package...
- Piece of shit!

122
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,598
I was hooked in seconds.

123
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,851
It was like mainlining adrenaline.

124
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,233
Yeah. Fuckface, look at
where the stock's at today, huh?

125
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,194
You motherfucker,
you can't get any at 44...

126
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,576
- Pick up the cocksucking phone!
- Sorry...

127
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,493
You are such
a fucking douchebag, Hanna.

128
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,325
We don't give two shits
about how technology works

129
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,036
because all we care about
is getting fucking rich.

130
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,441
- Solid, 2,000.
- Jordan Belfort.

131
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,920
Done!

132
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,634
Time to paint the tape.

133
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,968
2,000. Microsoft. Going in the hole!

134
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,341
Come on.

135
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,098
Live. Live. Hold on, that is hot.

136
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,102
In. In. Shut that motherfucker.
Shut it! Shut it! Shut it!

137
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,315
Sold!

138
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,743
Yeah.

139
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,006
Tootski?

140
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,509
Oh, no. Thank you, though.

141
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,181
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you
on this glorious afternoon?

142
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,976
Well, Hector, here's the game plan.

143
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,520
You're gonna bring us
two Absolut martinis.

144
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,142
You know howl like them. Straight up.

145
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,850
And then precisely seven
and one half minutes after that,

146
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,276
you're gonna bring us two more.

147
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:41,647
Then two more after that
every five minutes

148
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,949
until one of us passes the fuck out.

149
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,659
Excellent strategy, sir.

150
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,574
I'm good with water for now.

151
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,996
Thank you.

152
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,950
It's his first day on Wall Street.
Give him time.

153
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,752
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

154
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,792
Mr. Hanna?

155
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:04,170
You're able to do drugs during the day
and then still function, still do your job?

156
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,095
How the fuck else
would you do this job?

157
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,344
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

158
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,842
Right.

159
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:15,643
Well, I got to say, I'm incredibly excited
to be a part of your firm. I mean...

160
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,599
The clients you have are absolutely...

161
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,150
Fuck the clients.

162
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,980
Your only responsibility
is to put meat on the table.

163
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,316
You got a girlfriend?

164
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,945
I'm married. I have a wife.

165
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,119
Her name is Teresa. 
She cuts hair.

166
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,491
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

167
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,913
Think about Teresa.

168
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,160
Name of the game.

169
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:37,081
Move the money from
your client's pocket into your pocket.

170
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,249
Right.

171
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,001
But if you make your clients
money at the same time,

172
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,333
it's advantageous to everyone. Correct?

173
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,175
No.

174
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,170
Number one rule of Wall Street.

175
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,347
Nobody...

176
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,592
I don't care if you're Warren Buffett
or if you're Jimmy Buffett.

177
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:56,305
Nobody knows if a stock is gonna go up,
down, sideways, or in fucking circles.

178
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,389
Least of all stockbrokers, right?

179
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,067
It's all a fugazi.
You know what a fugazi is?

180
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,520
Fugayzi. It's a fake.

181
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,023
Fugayzi, fugazi,
it's a whazy, it's a woozy, it's...

182
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,450
Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.

183
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,950
It's never landed. It is no matter.
It's not on the elemental chart.

184
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,030
It's not fucking real.

185
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,957
- Right?
- Right.

186
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,747
Stay with me.

187
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,120
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

188
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,371
No.

189
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,298
So if you got a client
who bought stock at eight

190
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,797
and it now sits at 16,
he's all fucking happy.

191
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,971
He wants to cash in, liquidate,
take his fucking money and run home.

192
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,014
- You don't let him do that.
- Okay.

193
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,975
- 'Cause that would make it real.
- Right.

194
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,302
No. What do you do?

195
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,353
You get another brilliant idea.

196
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,892
A special idea.

197
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,569
Another "situation." Another stock
to reinvest his earnings and then some.

198
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,896
And he will, every single time.

199
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,068
'Cause they're fucking addicted.

200
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,235
And you just keep doing this,
again and again and again.

201
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,991
Meanwhile, he thinks
he's getting shit rich,

202
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,164
which he is, on paper.

203
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,912
But you and me, the brokers,

204
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:02,128
we're taking home cold hard cash
via commission, motherfucker.

205
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,917
Right.

206
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,593
That's incredible, sir.
I can't tell you how excited I am.

207
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,128
You should be.

208
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,966
There's two keys to success
in the broker business.

209
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,637
First of all...

210
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,680
- You gotta stay relaxed.
- Yeah.

211
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,888
Do you jerk off?

212
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,025
Do I... Do I jerk off?

213
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,319
Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.

214
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,691
How many times a week?

215
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,364
Like three or four.

216
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,738
- Three or four times, maybe five.
- Gotta pump those numbers up.

217
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,320
Those are rookie numbers
in this racket.

218
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:39,075
I myself, I jerk off at least twice a day.

219
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,871
- Wow.
- Once in the morning

220
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,419
right after I work out,
then once right after lunch.

221
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,871
Really?

222
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,878
I want to. That's not why I do it.

223
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,093
I do it 'cause I fucking need to.

224
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,678
Think about it.
You're dealing with numbers.

225
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,724
All day long, decimal points,
high frequencies.

226
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,845
Bang, bang, bang-

227
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,143
Fucking digits.

228
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,639
All very acidic
above-the-shoulders mustard shit.

229
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,974
All right?

230
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,567
It kind of wigs some people out. Right.

231
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,771
You got to feed the geese
to keep the blood flowing.

232
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,526
I keep the rhythm below the belt.

233
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,864
Done.

234
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,620
This is not a tip, this is a prescription.

235
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,863
Trust me.

236
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,453
If you don't, you will fall out of balance,

237
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,656
split your differential
and tip the fuck over.

238
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,036
Or worse yet,

239
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,334
I've seen this happen, implode.

240
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,877
No, I don't want to implode, sir.

241
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,125
No. No, you don't.

242
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,456
I'm in it for the long run, you know?

243
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,131
- Implosions are ugly.
- Yeah.

244
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,380
Pop off to the bathroom,
work one out any time you can.

245
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,460
When you get really good at it,

246
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,672
you'll fucking be stroking it
and you'll be thinking about money.

247
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,845
Second key to success in this racket

248
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,179
is this little baby right here.

249
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,639
It's called cocaine.

250
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,018
Right.

251
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,944
It'll keep you sharp between the ears.
It'll also help your fingers dial faster.

252
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,395
And guess what?

253
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,025
That's good for me.

254
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,024
Yes, sir.

255
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,284
Revolutions. You follow?

256
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,451
Revolutions.

257
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,780
Keep the clients on the Ferris wheel.

258
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,412
And it goes. The park is open 24/7, 365,

259
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,415
every decade, every goddamn century.

260
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,913
That's it.

261
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,710
The name of the game.

262
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,296
Halkidiki?

263
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,501
Thank you.

264
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:26,935
Come on.

265
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,063
We're the common denominator.

266
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,157
Keep it up for me.

267
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,163
You've seen the echo

268
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,789
And the money comes in

269
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,292
The parade comes to town

270
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,165
Going down Broadway

271
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,841
It's a one-way street

272
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,168
Whichever way I go

273
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,469
The next six months,

274
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,892
I got to know the ins
and outs of Wall Street.

275
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,597
Earning shit money as I geared up
to take my Series 7.

276
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,812
Oh, fuckers.

277
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:24,702
Then I was a licensed broker at last,

278
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,749
ready to make my fortune.

279
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:31,421
My first day as a future
Master of the Universe.

280
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,013
I have Exxon at 86 1/4 six months ago.

281
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,474
Today it is trading at 36 1/2.

282
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,721
Mr...

283
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,107
They called it Black Monday.

284
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,399
No shit.

285
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:56,571
By 4:00 p.m., the market
had dropped 508 points.

286
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,490
The biggest plummet
since the crash of '29.

287
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,942
I know your family, you know mine.

288
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,029
No, I don't know. Some fucking
country in Europe took a shit.

289
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,455
Let them do
what they want to fucking do.

290
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,782
Our market's solid.

291
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,584
This is not something
that you want to sell.

292
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,256
You know what happened?
A fucking tsunami.

293
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,536
I think you're making a big mistake.

294
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,213
- Yes, I will talk to your wife.
- Trust me, do not answer the phone.

295
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,258
A lot of people are gonna be calling you,
trying to get your dirty laundry.

296
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,961
- We don't know what's going on here.
- I know. I know.

297
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,390
Holy

298
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,310
fucking shit!

299
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,738
Unbelievable.

300
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,282
My first shitty day as a broker.

301
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,780
Within a month, L.F. Rothschild,

302
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,582
an institution since 1899,
closed its doors.

303
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,076
Wall Street had swallowed me up

304
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,537
and shit me right back out again.

305
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,216
We could pawn my engagement ring
if we needed to.

306
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,794
- Babe...
- Because I don't mind.

307
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:01,969
If we needed to, I'm saying...

308
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,591
- Will you listen to me?
- Okay.

309
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,799
You're not pawning anything. Okay?

310
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,262
- Okay.
- What do I always tell you?

311
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,541
You're gonna be a millionaire.

312
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,054
That's right. Okay? Just let me look.

313
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,226
We'll find something.

314
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,981
- How about this?
- What?

315
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,525
Nobody Beats the Wiz,
the electronics store.

316
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,069
Stock boy. What do you think?

317
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,399
You're not gonna work at that place.

318
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,521
Yeah, but, you know, you start off...

319
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,697
Jordan, you're gonna be
miserable at that place

320
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,853
- if you go there.
- I know.

321
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,118
It's sales. You work your way up,
you'll be a general manager.

322
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,991
- You're not gonna be a stock boy.
- Why not?

323
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,742
'Cause you're a stockbroker.

324
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,199
You understand that
nobody's hiring stockbrokers right now?

325
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:32,750
You understand that?

326
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,289
Okay?

327
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,050
This place is.

328
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,839
- What?
- What's that say?

329
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,136
"Stockbrokers."

330
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,881
In Long Island?

331
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,557
- Stockbrokers in Long Island?
- Yeah.

332
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,351
It's in Long Island. So what?

333
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,203
Hey, I'm looking for Investor's Center.

334
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,122
What's that? You want to invest?

335
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,292
No. Investor's Center.
I'm looking for Investor's Center.

336
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,046
Yeah, yeah, that's us. Hey.
This is it. This is it.

337
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,671
- I'm Dwayne. Yeah.
- You're Dwayne?

338
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,753
Hi, Dwayne. We spoke on the phone.

339
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,300
I'm Jordan Belfort.

340
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,633
I'm the broker from
Rothschild in New York.

341
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,809
Yes, yeah. Have a seat. How are you?

342
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,010
We had a conversation...

343
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,346
We spoke on the phone earlier, right?

344
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,771
- Two hours ago.
- Right.

345
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,847
Yeah.

346
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,977
They're up and comers.
That's what that means.

347
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,900
It's three cents a share, that's $3!

348
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,447
You cheap fuck!

349
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,399
So...

350
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,452
So where are your Quotrons here?

351
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,412
- Quotrons?
- Yeah. Your computers.

352
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,784
No, no. We don't even need 
computers here.

353
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,623
We just trade right off
the pink sheets here.

354
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,492
- Pink sheets?
- Yeah, they're penny stocks.

355
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,419
You know, companies that
can't get listed on NASDAQ,

356
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,734
they don't have enough capital?

357
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,876
Their shares trade here.

358
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,673
- Penny stocks?
- Yeah.

359
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,627
This one, Aerodyne,
is a really interesting...

360
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,087
Or Aerotyne...

361
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,637
Aerotyne, yeah.

362
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,348
Aero... Aerotyne...

363
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,800
Aerotyne. Yeah.

364
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,008
Very hot stock right now.

365
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,093
Oh, yeah?

366
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,428
They're just a couple
of brothers that are making

367
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,808
radar detectors out of their garage.

368
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,266
- They're out in Dubuque.
- Maybe it's microwaves. I'm not sure.

369
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,828
But you call the company's main line,

370
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,648
their mom, Dorothy, answers
and she is so sweet.

371
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,650
- Good company.
- I actually don't know what else to...

372
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,323
I don't know anything else
about them other than that.

373
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,945
Six cents a share?

374
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,987
Hey, come on. Who buys this crap?

375
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,200
Well, I mean...

376
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,613
Honestly, mostly schmucks.

377
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,699
Postmen, there's always postmen.

378
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,701
Plumbers.

379
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,833
They see our ads 'm the back
of Hustler and Popular Mechanics.

380
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,756
Our ads actually say
they can get rich quick.

381
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,041
Hustler?
- Yeah.

382
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,342
You know, those girlie magazines.

383
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,886
Yeah, yeah. Nudie mag.

384
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,095
- A lot.
- Yeah.

385
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,805
We're helping them finance houses,

386
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,881
we're helping them
buy their wife a diamond ring...

387
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:54,930
A boat maybe.

388
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,895
Is this... Is this stuff regulated
or are you guys...

389
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,062
What are you doing here?

390
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,941
Sort of.

391
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,231
Sort of?

392
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,485
Jesus Christ,
the spread on these is huge.

393
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,816
Yeah. And that's the point, that's...

394
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:10,991
What's your name again?

395
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,410
Mine... Jordan Belfort.

396
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,320
Jordan, what do you get
on that blue chip stock?

397
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,415
I make one percent.
Or I did make one percent.

398
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,333
Pink sheets, it's 50.

399
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,580
It's 50%?

400
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,790
50% commission?

401
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,584
- Yup.
- For what?

402
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,794
It's our markup for our services.

403
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,596
And so if I... If I...

404
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,722
if I sell a stock at $10,000,
my commission is 5,000 bucks?

405
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,349
If you sell $10,000 worth of this stock,

406
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,022
I will personally give you
a blowjob for free.

407
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,476
And I hope it happens.

408
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,105
Hello, John, how are you doing today?

409
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,820
You mailed in my company
a postcard a few weeks back

410
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,745
requesting information on penny stocks
that had huge upside potential

411
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,493
with very little downside risk.

412
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,494
- Does that ring a bell?
- Yeah, I may have sent something.

413
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,702
Okay, great.
The reason for the call today, John, is,

414
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,459
something just came
across my desk, John.

415
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,542
It is perhaps the best thing
I've seen in the last six months.

416
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,548
If you have 60 seconds, I'd like to share
the idea with you. You got a minute?

417
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,628
Actually, I'm really very...

418
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,181
The name of the company,
Aerotyne International.

419
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,510
It is a cutting edge
high-tech firm out of the Midwest

420
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,511
awaiting imminent patent approval

421
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,143
on the next generation
of radar detectors

422
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:27,644
that have both huge military
and civilian applications now.

423
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,024
Right now, John,

424
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,568
the stock trades over-the-counter
at 10 cents a share.

425
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,029
And by the way, John,
our analysts indicate

426
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,406
it could go a heck
of a lot higher than that.

427
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:42,458
Your profit on a mere $6,000 investment
would be upwards of $60,000!

428
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,080
Jesus! That's my mortgage, man.

429
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,761
Exactly. You could
pay off your mortgage.

430
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,330
This stock will pay off my house?

431
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,508
John, one thing I can promise you,
even in this market,

432
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,091
is that I never ask my clients
to judge me on my winners.

433
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:57,765
I ask them to judge me on my losers
because I have so few.

434
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,429
And in the case of Aerotyne,

435
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,136
based on every technical factor
out there, John,

436
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,348
we are looking at
a grand slam home run.

437
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,309
Okay, let's do it. I'll do four grand.

438
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,611
$4,000? That'd be 40,000 shares, John.

439
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,170
Let me lock in that trade right now

440
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,526
and get back to you with my secretary

441
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,529
with an exact confirmation.
Sound good, John?

442
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,860
- Yeah, sounds good.
- Great.

443
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,114
Hey, John.

444
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,242
Thank you for your vote of confidence.

445
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,801
And welcome to the Investor's Center.

446
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:22,948
Yeah, thanks a lot, man.

447
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,325
Bye-bye.

448
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,376
How'd you fucking do that?

449
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,130
Just like that, I made two grand.

450
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,963
The other guys looked at me
like I'd just discovered fire.

451
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,799
Great! Even better!

452
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,554
I was selling garbage to garbage men
and making cash hand over fist.

453
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,366
The only problem you're gonna have
is that you didn't buy more.

454
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,892
So I was selling them shit.

455
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,734
But the way I looked at it,
their money was better off in my pocket.

456
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,656
I knew how to spend it better.

457
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,404
Excuse me. Is that your car in the lot?

458
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,906
Yeah.

459
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,946
- It's a nice ride.
- Thanks, man.

460
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,246
Donnie Azoff.

461
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,365
Hey. I'm Jordan Belfort.

462
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,745
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

463
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,668
You know, actually,
I see that car around.

464
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,423
- I see it around a lot.
- Oh, yeah, where?

465
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,293
I think we live in the same building.

466
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,464
- No shit?
- Yeah, yeah.

467
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,258
- Twelfth floor?
- Yeah. What floor are you on?

468
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,467
Fourth floor.

469
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,386
- I have two little kids. Ugly wife.
- Right.

470
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,430
What do you do, bro?

471
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,384
What do you mean, what do I do?

472
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,681
For work, what do you do?

473
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,932
I'm a stockbroker.

474
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,768
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

475
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,436
Children's furniture.

476
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,812
Oh, good for you.

477
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,268
It's all right.

478
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,812
You make a lot of money?

479
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,947
Yeah, I do all right for myself.

480
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,306
I'm trying to put it together.

481
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,323
You got your fucking nice car,
we live in the same building. I just...

482
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,996
I'm not understanding...
How much money do you make?

483
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,875
I don't know. $70,000 last month.

484
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,752
Get the fuck...

485
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,628
Get the fuck out of here.

486
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:52,959
No, I'm serious.

487
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,294
Yeah, no, I'm serious, too.

488
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,417
Seriously, how much money
do you make?

489
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,803
I told you. $70,000.

490
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,426
Well, technically, $72,000.

491
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,473
Last month. Something like that.

492
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,560
You made 72 grand in one month?

493
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,807
Yeah.

494
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,483
I'll tell you what.

495
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,737
You show me a pay stub
for $72,000 on it,

496
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,156
I quit my job right now
and I work for you.

497
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,494
Hey, Paulie, what's up?

498
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,913
No, yeah, yeah. No, everything's fine.

499
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,411
Hey, listen, I quit.

500
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,378
And he did quit his job.

501
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,419
Which I thought was a little weird.
I mean, I just met this fucking guy.

502
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,380
Don't fucking tell Susan.
It's none of her business.

503
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,797
There were other things about him, too.

504
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,005
Like his phosphorescent white teeth.

505
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,259
wife! I gotta fucking
deal with your wife?

506
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,512
The fact that he wore
horn rims with clear lenses

507
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,559
just to look more WASP-y.

508
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,514
And then, there were these rumors.

509
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,228
I heard some stupid shit. I don't know.

510
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,776
Fuck, I didn't even want
to bring it up. It's just...

511
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,649
- it's stupid.
- Shit with me?

512
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,898
You know, people say shit.
I don't even know.

513
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,403
I don't even listen to it half the time.

514
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,068
What are they saying?

515
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,613
Shit about you and your cousin
or something like that.

516
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,913
I don't even listen to it.

517
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,538
Bro, it's not like that.

518
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,081
It's not like that.

519
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,879
Like you married your cousin
or some stupid shit. No?

520
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:17,961
Yeah, my wife. Yeah.

521
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,792
My wife is my cousin, or whatever.

522
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,503
But it's not like what you think,
or whatever, you know.

523
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,554
Is she like a first cousin, or is she...

524
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,885
Yeah, no, she's, you know...

525
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,925
Her... Her father

526
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,678
is the brother of my mom.

527
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,395
It's not like, what... You know.

528
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,015
Look, we grew up together.

529
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,476
And she grew up hot, you know.
She fucking grew up hot.

530
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,310
And all my friends were
trying to fuck her, you know.

531
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,271
And I'm not gonna let someone...

532
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,943
You know, one of these assholes
fuck my cousin,

533
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,492
so, you know, I used the cousin thing
as like an in with her.

534
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,078
I'm not gonna let
someone else fuck my cousin.

535
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,833
You know, if anyone's
gonna fuck my cousin,

536
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,782
it's gonna be me,
out of respect. You know?

537
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,991
No, I get it. Yeah.

538
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,248
I mean, you're not afraid of like
the whole kid thing, right?

539
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,541
- What? Having kids with her?
- Yeah.

540
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,837
No. We have two kids.

541
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,377
And they're... I mean...

542
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,050
I don't want to get personal,
but they're okay?

543
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,254
No, they're not retarded
or anything like that.

544
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,263
But there's a big chance, right, if...

545
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,682
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,

546
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,261
60 to 65% chance the kid's
gonna be fucking retarded or whatever.

547
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,436
That'd scare the shit out of me, buddy.

548
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,852
Look, man, a lot of having a kid,
or whatever, takes risk,

549
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,683
whether you're fucking cousins or not.

550
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,519
What if something like that happened?

551
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,195
Basically, you know,
if the kid was retarded,

552
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:25,571
I would, you know,
drive it up to the country

553
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,322
and just, like, you know,
open the door and say,

554
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,616
"You're free now."
You know, like, "Run free."

555
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,204
You know?

556
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,962
You're completely fucking with me.

557
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,965
That's horrible. You're not gonna...

558
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,634
You look like you've... No.

559
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,552
We would take it to, like,
an institution or somewhere

560
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,426
that's handled to, like, you know,
raise the kid or whatever.

561
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,054
You know what? If you're happy,
God bless you, buddy.

562
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:54,478
No, I'm not fucking happy.
No one who's married is fucking happy.

563
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,309
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, buddy.

564
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,395
Listen, I'm really, you know...

565
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,818
I'm really appreciative
for this fucking job.

566
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,068
I'm really enjoying it.

567
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,566
I'm really happy with what you're doing.

568
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,943
Actually, I got you a little present.

569
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,442
- You got me a present?
- I got you something.

570
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,821
Oh, fuck. You're sweet.

571
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,159
Yeah. It's in the back though.

572
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,664
- What do you mean?
- You gotta go out back.

573
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,998
Like it's wrapped up or something?

574
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,583
It's wrapped up. Yeah.

575
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,784
- I don't get it.
- Neither do I.

576
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,336
Let's fucking go. Come on.

577
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,580
Your turn.

578
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,757
I'm not fucking doing this.
You're out of your fucking mind.

579
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,797
- Smoke this shit, bro.
- No.

580
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,878
No one's fucking here, bro.

581
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,008
Get the fuck...

582
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,886
Fucking smoke crack with me, bro.

583
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,090
I'm not fucking doing it.

584
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,893
Smoke crack. Smoke some
fucking crack with me, bro.

585
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,346
- One hit. One hit. That's it.
- Okay.

586
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,352
Fucking nut job.

587
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,084
Wow!

588
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,876
Wow.

589
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:11,889
Let's go run, huh?

590
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,095
We gotta get out of here, buddy.

591
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,977
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go fucking run.

592
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,477
Let's run like we're fucking lions
and tigers and bears!

593
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,066
Let's run! Let's fucking run!

594
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:25,151
Let's fucking run! Go!

595
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,612
Go, go, go, go!

596
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,065
You've reached Frank's Best Auto Body.

597
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,651
We're closed right now.

598
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,735
So please leave us a message.

599
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,492
Hello. My name is Jordan Belfort.

600
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,996
My partner and I are very interested
in renting out your garage.

601
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,543
Donnie and I were
going out on our own.

602
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,962
And the first thing
we needed was brokers.

603
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,960
Guys with sales experience.

604
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,962
So I recruited
some of my hometown boys.

605
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,215
Sea Otter, who sold meat and weed.

606
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,674
Chester, who sold tires and weed.

607
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,600
And Robbie, who sold anything
he could get his hands on.

608
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,973
Mostly weed.

609
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,597
Can you bring me some ketchup? Okay?

610
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,106
This is Brad.

611
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,855
And Brad's the guy I really wanted.

612
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,185
But he didn't go along with us.

613
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:08,817
He was already making
so much money selling Quaaludes,

614
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,649
he'd become the Quaalude king
of Bayside.

615
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:12,820
Getting any pussy
with that thing or what?

616
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,867
Yeah, man, of course.

617
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,865
Bring some of them chicks
around here sometime, huh?

618
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,196
Let 'em watch.

619
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,122
Let 'em watch. Know what I mean?

620
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:23,210
Hey, Zip! You tell your sister
I was asking about her.

621
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,463
Why don't you bring me a pair of
her panties next time you come through.

622
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,382
Yeah, man. She said she don't want
to talk to you anymore, man.

623
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,672
Get the fuck out of here.

624
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,962
Hey, Ma, we got chicken or what?

625
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,014
Ma!

626
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,675
You listening? It's easier than you think.

627
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,222
Every person you're on the phone with,

628
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,805
they want to get rich
and they want to get rich quickly.

629
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,060
They all want something for nothing.

630
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,608
There was this one time that
I was selling pot to this Amish dude.

631
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,060
You know those guys
who got like the beard

632
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,191
with like no mustache or some bullshit?

633
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:54,150
Well, he says that he only
wants to make furniture.

634
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:55,742
I don't understand.

635
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:56,989
What's that got to do with anything?

636
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,950
What the fuck are you talking about?

637
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,906
I'm not putting words
in your mouth or nothing,

638
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,163
but you just said that
everybody wants to get rich.

639
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,670
Holy fuck, you did just say that.

640
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,081
What the fuck are you talking about?

641
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,258
Yeah, like Buddhists.
They don't give a shit about money.

642
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,335
They're wrapped in sheets.
They're not buying shit.

643
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,170
I'm not talking about
Buddhists or Amish.

644
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,007
I'm talking about normal people,
working-class, everyday people.

645
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,013
Everyone wants to get rich. Am I crazy?

646
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,389
There's no such thing
as an Amish Buddhist.

647
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,345
- I'm pretty fucking sure.
- There could be.

648
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,689
Can we get some ketchup, please?

649
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,164
Do you guys not want to make money?

650
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,976
I want to make some money.

651
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,356
I want to make
some fucking money, okay.

652
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,778
I can sell anything.

653
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,776
Shit, I can sell ludes
to a convent full of nuns,

654
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,855
and get them so horny
they'd be fucking each other.

655
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,700
That's the attitude.
You can sell anything?

656
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,369
Sell me this fucking pen right here.

657
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,124
You can sell anything.
Sell that. Go ahead.

658
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,368
Sell me the pen.

659
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,158
Can I finish eating first?
I haven't eaten today.

660
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,623
Brad, show them how it's done. Boom.

661
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,212
Sell me that pen. Watch. Go on.

662
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,851
You want me to sell this fucking pen?

663
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,417
That's my boy right there.
Can fucking sell anything.

664
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,501
Why don't you do me a favor.

665
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,264
Write your name down
on that napkin for me.

666
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,383
I don't have a pen.

667
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,180
Exactly. Supply and demand, my friend.

668
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,348
- Holy shit.
- See what I'm saying?

669
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:01,801
He's creating urgency.

670
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,344
Get them to want to buy the stock.

671
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,304
Convince them it's something
they need, you know what I mean?

672
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,559
And that's the thing.

673
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,140
All nuns are lesbians.

674
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,142
What the fuck
are you talking about, Otter?

675
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,024
Think about it. They can't keep a dude
so they're gonna start fucking chicks.

676
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,231
Four fucking times, Kimmie! Four times.

677
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,837
- He's not with us.
- Friggin' Rambo.

678
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,200
Now she runs.

679
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:21,161
But look. I knew these guys
weren't like Harvard MBAs.

680
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:25,161
Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead,
took five years to finish high school.

681
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,164
Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter,
didn't even graduate.

682
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,506
Chester Ming, the depraved Chinaman,
thought jujitsu was in Israel.

683
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,050
Smartest of the bunch
was Nicky Koskoff.

684
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,798
He actually went to law school.

685
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:40,302
I called him Rugrat
because of his piece of shit hairpiece.

686
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,218
Still, give them to me
young, hungry and stupid

687
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,350
and in no time, I'll make them rich.

688
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,599
Oh, my God.

689
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,150
Jordan, that...

690
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:53,560
You like it, baby?

691
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,395
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

692
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,902
They're not the biggest stones
in the world,

693
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,733
but I promise they're really high quality.

694
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,193
It's beautiful.

695
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,195
They're so beautiful.

696
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:04,780
Oh, boy.

697
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,281
What?

698
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,868
I know that look. What is it? Go ahead.

699
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,623
I don't know, it's... You know...

700
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,501
These stocks... These companies...

701
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,632
They're like crappy companies.

702
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,001
- Well, yeah.
- Okay.

703
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,468
Yeah, they're terrible.

704
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,057
Don't worry about it. I told you,
what I'm doing is completely legal.

705
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,177
Yeah, I know.

706
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,384
But they're not gonna make
anyone money though, right?

707
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,261
Well, sometimes they do,
sometimes they don't.

708
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,767
You know how it goes.

709
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,411
Wouldn't you feel better
if you sold that stuff to rich people

710
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,444
who can, like, afford
to lose all that money?

711
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:37,646
Of course.

712
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,862
But rich people don't buy penny stocks.

713
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,826
They just don't.

714
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,490
Why not?

715
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:49,662
Because they're too smart,
that's why not.

716
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,749
I mean, what person
with a college education

717
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,125
would trust this bunch of jerk-offs?

718
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,421
Hang up the phone.
Tell him you'll call him back.

719
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,589
I got five fucking grand
on the phone right now!

720
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,712
Hey!

721
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:00,761
But what if they didn't sound
like a bunch of jerk-offs?

722
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:04,097
What if I could teach them
how to sell to people with money?

723
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,674
Real money.

724
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,934
So I decided to reinvent the company.

725
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,638
Gentlemen, welcome

726
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,516
to Stratton Oakmont.

727
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:18,696
You schnooks will now be targeting
the wealthiest 1% of Americans.

728
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,822
We're talking about whales here.

729
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,774
Moby fucking Dicks.

730
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:27,075
And with this script,
which is now your new harpoon,

731
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,248
I'm gonna teach
each and every one of you

732
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,992
to be Captain fucking Ahab.

733
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,706
Get it? Huh?

734
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,166
Captain who?

735
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:36,667
Captain Ahab. From the fucking...

736
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,334
The book, motherfucker. From the book.

737
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,419
Turn your fucking brain on.

738
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,004
- Fuck you.
- Jesus fuck, Robbie.

739
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,931
Listen to me.
We're a new company with a new name.

740
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:50,181
A company that
our clients can believe in.

741
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,184
A company that our clients can trust.

742
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:57,814
A firm whose roots are
so deeply embedded into Wall Street

743
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:01,318
that our very founders
sailed over on the Mayflower

744
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,239
and chiseled the name
Stratton Oakmont

745
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,613
right into Plymouth fucking Rock!

746
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:06,985
You got it?

747
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,245
What we're gonna do is this.

748
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:14,498
First we pitch 'em Disney, AT&T, IBM,
blue chip stocks exclusively.

749
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,749
Companies these people know.

750
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,875
Once we've suckered them in,
we unload the dog shit.

751
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,674
The pink sheets, the penny stocks,
where we make the money.

752
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,922
50% commission, baby.

753
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,008
Now the key to making money
in a situation like this

754
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,095
is to position yourself now
before the settlement.

755
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,102
Because by the time you read about it
in The Wall Street Journal,

756
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,058
it's already too late.

757
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,276
Then you wait.

758
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,444
You wait.

759
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,114
And whoever speaks first loses.

760
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,366
Sorry...

761
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,948
I appreciate the call.

762
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:53,240
I really have to give this some thought
and talk to my wife about it.

763
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:54,666
Can I call you back?

764
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,038
They don't know, right?
They gotta think about it,

765
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,495
they gotta talk to their fucking wives,
or the fucking Tooth Fairy.

766
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,376
Point is, it doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

767
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:03,959
The only real objection that they have
is that they don't trust you guys.

768
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,669
And why should they trust you?
I mean, look at you.

769
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,714
You're a bunch of fucking
sleazy salesmen, right?

770
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,299
So, what do you say?

771
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,556
You mean to tell me that if I put you in
at Union Carbide at seven

772
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:15,057
and took you out at 32...

773
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,730
Texas Instruments at 11
and took you out at 47...

774
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,275
U.S. Steel at 16, took you out at 41...

775
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,023
You wouldn't be saying
to me right now, "Chester,

776
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,895
"pick me up
a few thousand shares of Disney

777
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,107
"on the spot, right now. Come on."

778
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,532
Honestly, Kevin? Honestly? Seriously?

779
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,950
I don't know you.

780
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,323
You cold-called me.
You're a total stranger.

781
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,366
I am in complete agreement with you.
You don't know me, I don't know you.

782
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,955
Let me introduce myself to you.
My name is Alden Kupferberg.

783
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,376
- Robbie Feinberg.
- Chester Ming.

784
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,291
I'm Senior Vice President
at Stratton Oakmont...

785
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,810
and I plan on being one of the...

786
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,169
top brokers in my firm next year.

787
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,289
And I'm not gonna get there
by being wrong, Stanley.

788
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,257
I do wanna say that you sound like a...

789
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,088
You sound like a pretty sincere guy.

790
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,424
It's not gonna make you rich
and it's not gonna make you poor.

791
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,976
But what this trade will do is serve as...

792
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,304
a benchmark for
future business, Kevin.

793
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,227
You feel comfortable
with me now, Scotty?

794
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,599
And then you'll know for sure

795
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,730
that you finally found
a broker on Wall Street

796
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,356
that you can trust,

797
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:08,031
and who can consistently
make you money.

798
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,532
Sound fair enough?

799
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,536
You know what... Yeah.

800
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,498
I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed.

801
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,330
What are you thinking?

802
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,501
Kevin.

803
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,954
You give me one shot here

804
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,666
on a blue chip stock like Kodak,

805
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,968
and believe me, Kevin,

806
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,546
the only problem you're gonna have

807
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,052
is that you didn't buy more.

808
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,716
Sound fair enough?

809
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,264
Shit. My...

810
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,808
My wife might divorce me, but...

811
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,058
Yeah, let's do it.

812
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,149
Excellent choice, Kevin.

813
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,071
How much do you
want to go for this time?

814
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,107
Let's do five... $5,000.

815
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,363
Can we try 8,000, Kevin?

816
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:53,785
All right. Let's do 10.

817
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,190
- Ten.
- You want to do that?

818
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,237
Excellent choice!

819
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,120
Kevin, let me lock in that trade right now
and get back to you in a few minutes

820
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,560
with an exact confirmation, Kevin.

821
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,169
And welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

822
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,417
Thanks, man. Pm gonna have a beer.

823
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,627
This is fun.

824
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,923
Take it easy, Kev.

825
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,926
Hey, thanks, Jordan. Thanks a...

826
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,592
Fuck that motherfucker!

827
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,548
That's what I'm talking about!

828
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,306
What a fucking idiot.

829
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,852
The one thing I know about
in this world is airlines.

830
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,310
And Cuchon Airlines
is the future of airlines.

831
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,526
Get in now or...

832
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,354
- I'm Nicky Koskoff...
- Chester Ming...

833
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,940
and I'm a Senior Vice President
with Stratton Oakmont.

834
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:36,161
Judy, I am so, so, so sorry for your loss.

835
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,703
When did he pass?

836
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:38,819
Just say I'm wrong, right.

837
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,910
And the stock goes down
a couple points...

838
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,491
and it makes you,
in the words of my grandfather,

839
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:44,373
God rest his soul, "A shit ton of money."

840
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,578
It's like getting in on fucking sunlight

841
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,289
before there was fucking sunlight.
You understand?

842
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,128
Can we do 8,000 shares?

843
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,675
Okay, 25,000.

844
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,796
That's a very intelligent decision.

845
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,638
I'm gonna transfer you
to my sales associate.

846
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,470
Rhonda!

847
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,471
- Rhonda!
- ...put you through to Andrea.

848
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,178
Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda?

849
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,069
Everybody have a good week?

850
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,191
Yeah!

851
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,689
The end of the month.

852
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:16,193
$28.7 million in gross commissions,

853
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,576
all from pink sheet stock, boys!

854
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,909
And to celebrate with
our weekly act of debauchery,

855
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,744
I have offered
our lovely sales assistant,

856
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,750
Danielle Harrison, here,

857
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:31,584
$10,000 to shave her fucking head!

858
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,376
Yeah!

859
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,338
Yeah, you want this?

860
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,505
You want this?

861
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,016
Let's scalp her! Scalp her!

862
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,435
Let the scalping begin!

863
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,478
Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!

864
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:54,691
FYI, boys, Danielle has promised
to use this $10,000 for breast implants!

865
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:58,198
She's already got C cups,
but now she wants fucking double D's!

866
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,033
Is this a great fucking
company or what?

867
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,243
Is this the greatest company
in the world?

868
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,667
Donnie!

869
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,209
Blow the roof off this motherfucker!

870
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,451
Champagne?

871
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,832
Send in the stripees!

872
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:26,285
Mine!

873
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,967
Word about us spread
throughout Wall Street.

874
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,347
Even the places I didn't want it to.

875
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,030
It wasn't long before Forbes magazine,

876
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,904
the flagship of Wall Street,
called to do a profile on me.

877
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:05,283
Let me ask you, how do you see
the future for Stratton Oakmont?

878
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,533
One word?

879
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,742
Diversification.

880
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,122
Sounds good. Thank you so much.
I have more than enough.

881
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,202
- I appreciate your time.
- Fantastic.

882
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:14,367
Can we get a quick picture?

883
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,879
A total fucking hatchet job.

884
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,131
This conniving little twat! Look at this!

885
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:24,381
"The Wolf of Wall Street"
they call me. Look.

886
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,431
Your hair looks good.

887
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,928
- Well, my hair looks good.
- Yeah.

888
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,138
"Jordan Belfort, sounding like
a kind of twisted Robin Hood

889
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,848
"who takes from the rich
and gives to himself

890
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,725
"and his merry little band of brokers."

891
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,651
- Read that. Read it.
- Listen.

892
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:41,106
There is no such thing
as bad publicity, sweetheart.

893
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,691
Read the article, babe.

894
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,235
Jordan, you look great!
You're in a huge magazine.

895
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,907
Big fucking deal I look great.

896
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,531
Mr. Belfort! Can you
look at my resume, please?

897
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,537
Excuse me, excuse me, sir!

898
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,412
Calm the fuck down!

899
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,292
What the hell's all this?

900
00:40:57,497 --> 00:41:00,216
It's the Forbes article.
They all want to work for you now.

901
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,467
Hey! What did I say?

902
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,714
I'm just trying to be nice.

903
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,638
Hey, you want a job, you talk to me!

904
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,006
- Mr. Belfort!
- Give me one minute.

905
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,722
Forbes made me a superstar.

906
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:15,774
Every day, dozens of money-crazed
kids beat a path to my door.

907
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,770
If we hired 'em, they dropped
straight out of college overnight

908
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:23,982
and spent whatever allowance they had
on a new suit from our Stratton tailor.

909
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,612
Are you fucking serious right now?

910
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:29,784
I mean, we were literally
putting clothes on these kids' backs.

911
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,874
And here comes this jerk-off
sniffing around.

912
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,123
But, you know, every time
someone rises up in this world,

913
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,581
there's always gonna be
some asshole trying to drag him down.

914
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:44,928
Within months, we doubled in size,
moved to even bigger offices.

915
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,595
It was a madhouse.

916
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,267
A greed-fest,

917
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:59,271
with equal parts cocaine,
testosterone, and body fluids.

918
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:00,810
Yes!

919
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:05,441
It got so bad, I had to declare
the office a fuck-free zone

920
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,446
between the hours of 9:00 and 7:00.

921
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,199
But I'm telling you, even that didn't help.

922
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:13,327
Actually, the madness started
on our very first day,

923
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,874
when one of our brokers, Ben Jenner,

924
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,077
christened the elevator
by getting a blowjob

925
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,707
from a sales assistant.

926
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,663
Her name was Pam, and to her credit,

927
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:25,799
she did have this amazing technique,
with this wild twist and jerk motion.

928
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,303
About a month later,

929
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,301
Donnie and I decided
to double-team her

930
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,552
on a Saturday afternoon

931
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,384
while our wives were out
shopping for Christmas dresses.

932
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,057
Eventually, Ben married her,

933
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,605
which was pretty amazing
considering she blew

934
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,978
every single guy in the office.

935
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,319
Then he got depressed
and killed himself three years later.

936
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:47,862
Anyway, I hired my dad, Max,
to maintain order as the Enforcer.

937
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,613
Stratton's very own Gestapo.

938
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,490
We called him Mad Max
because of his hair-trigger temper,

939
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,497
which could be set off by something
as innocuous as a ringing telephone.

940
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,288
Who the fuck has the goddamn gall

941
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,999
to call this house on a Tuesday night?

942
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,251
God damn it!

943
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,382
You're gonna miss it!

944
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,304
Please, tell me something I don't know.

945
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,132
I wait all week for the fucking Equalizer

946
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,514
and they have to fucking... Hello.

947
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,311
But as soon as
he picked up the phone...

948
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,683
Gene. How are you, Gene?

949
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,728
He'd affect this weird British accent.

950
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,026
Right-o, Gene, that'd be great.

951
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,314
Cheerio.

952
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,440
It was absolutely bizarre.

953
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,067
The fucking halfwit!

954
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,193
- He'd hang up...
- You missed it!

955
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,525
And then he's Mad Max allover again.

956
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,651
Damn it!

957
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,949
All right, tell me what happened.
What happened?

958
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,160
Well, he discovered
it was the mother's sister.

959
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,661
Who's he? Who? Tell me who...

960
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,333
The main guy.
You know who the main...

961
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,500
The main guy...

962
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,920
it was his mother's sister.
She showed up dead.

963
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,965
Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know

964
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,713
everything we were doing at Stratton.

965
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,840
And then there's a big target and we...

966
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,887
They get launched at the target.
They stick.

967
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,098
There's a bull's-eye and
the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.

968
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,265
Whoever gets closer to the dollar sign

969
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,308
gets the most points.

970
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,665
I'm gonna throw the shit out
of this little fucking thing.

971
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,601
So if it gets hurt, what happens?

972
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,977
'Cause we're gonna get fucking nuts.

973
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,308
I don't think he's gonna get hurt.
They're like...

974
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,143
They got like superhuman strength.

975
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,443
I think he's gonna be fine.

976
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,487
You can't look him right in the eyes.

977
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:09,763
You can't look him in the eye?

978
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,445
That's a fact. I saw it on PBS.

979
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,408
They get confused
and their wires get crossed.

980
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,031
You gotta look at their chin.

981
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,158
Like it looks like I'm looking at you

982
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,238
but I'm looking at your chin.

983
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,494
I feel like you're addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?

984
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,451
They're like the Mona Lisa.
They find eye contact,

985
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,081
like, wherever you are
standing in the room.

986
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:24,370
And they lock in.

987
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,082
No, but there is a limit
to what we can do with them?

988
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,291
We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.

989
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,896
We're allowed to throw food? Bananas.

990
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,339
Any food. Correct.

991
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,466
But, for example, what I wouldn't do is

992
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,297
maybe like tell him to pull his cock out

993
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,100
and like get some
of the girls to, you know,

994
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,262
fondle him and shit like that.

995
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,342
That would be... That's unacceptable?

996
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:39,427
Let's keep that in our back pocket.

997
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,512
This guy is more about
throwing at the dartboard.

998
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:42,597
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.

999
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,065
The thing is, this is their gift, okay.

1000
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,188
They're built to be thrown
like a lawn dart.

1001
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,484
They're top heavy like a lawn dart.

1002
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,561
So they're built for accuracy.

1003
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,612
Oh, my God. Can we bowl with this guy?

1004
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:51,772
That's his fucking brother, Rob.

1005
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,199
His brother's the bowling ball.

1006
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:54,992
The brother, you put
a skateboard on him,

1007
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,364
you strap him to a skateboard,

1008
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,821
you toss him down
an alley at some pins.

1009
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,531
- No shit. That's interesting.
- Swear to fucking God.

1010
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,616
- Can we get that guy?
- Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.

1011
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,793
But it says here this guy
will show his cock. Yeah.

1012
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,120
- Instead of growing up. Yeah.
- He will?

1013
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,500
They are very ornery by the way,

1014
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:07,956
so you gotta be very careful
with these little guys.

1015
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,086
Safety first.

1016
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,257
Safety is first, all right?

1017
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,210
I want somebody with
a fucking tranquilizer gun

1018
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,920
ready to knock this fucker out.

1019
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,176
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace. Taser guns.

1020
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,256
A pellet gun maybe?

1021
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,466
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.

1022
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,892
I just want him out. 
Knocked out cold.

1023
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,554
But I say we stick with the loophole.
Right? Okay?

1024
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,555
If we don't consider him a human,

1025
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,800
we just consider it an act,
I think we're in the clear.

1026
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,896
Like The Flying Wallendas.

1027
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,943
You know, a lot of those guys died
but they never sued anybody.

1028
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:31,771
The important thing
you guys gotta keep in mind

1029
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,697
is that these things gossip.

1030
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,407
They get together and they gossip.

1031
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:36,860
- That's a good point.
- And the last thing

1032
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,116
that we need is them
getting together and saying,

1033
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,788
"Oh, they made fun of us."

1034
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,464
Like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad.

1035
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,625
That's why I love you.
You think of shit like that.

1036
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,704
When they come in,
we treat it just like one of us. Okay?

1037
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:51,083
One of us. Gooble gobble, one of us.

1038
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:52,754
We accept them, one of us!

1039
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,544
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1040
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:55,966
We accept them, one of us.

1041
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,092
Gooble gobble, one of us!

1042
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,468
Jordan! Your dad's coming.

1043
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,015
Something about
the American Express bill.

1044
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,295
Can you get him out of here?

1045
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:02,510
Yeah. Lick my twat.

1046
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:03,849
No, I'm serious!

1047
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,271
Fuck. Guys, act like we're working.

1048
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:07,815
You got any fucking stock forms?

1049
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,438
He's coming, he's coming.

1050
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,689
Make some shit up.

1051
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,774
I think if we short Pfizer...

1052
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:17,780
$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?

1053
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:23,202
Four hundred and fucking 30,000
fucking dollars in one fucking month!

1054
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,454
Good morning.
They're business expenses. Relax.

1055
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:26,750
- Business expenses?
- Yes.

1056
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,248
- Jordy, look what you got here.
- What?

1057
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:32,207
Look at this. $26,000
for one fucking dinner!

1058
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,000
Okay. No, no. This could be explained.

1059
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,511
Dad, we had clients. The Pfizer clients.

1060
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,467
Right. The porterhouse from Argentina.

1061
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,799
Expensive champagne and...
We had to buy champagne.

1062
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,401
And you ordered all the fucking sides.

1063
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,506
- Tell him about the sides.
- I ordered sides, so...

1064
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,980
Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?

1065
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,391
What are these sides?
They cure cancer?

1066
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,359
The sides did cure cancer.
That's the problem.

1067
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,857
That's why they were expensive.

1068
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,863
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm serious.

1069
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,945
- Stop.
- And EJ Entertainment?

1070
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,822
What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?

1071
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:02,654
Well, that's...

1072
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:03,829
Yeah, Jordy, what's EJ Entertainment?

1073
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:04,996
How do I describe this?

1074
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,073
Jord, what is that?

1075
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,251
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!
- I know.

1076
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,415
- That's what it is!
- That is what it is.

1077
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,504
Isn't that the perfect description for it?

1078
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,174
That is what it is.
But none of these were charged to me.

1079
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,592
This is all of them.

1080
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:18,469
- Oh, that was all us?
- It wasn't me though.

1081
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,387
Fucking explain this shit to him!

1082
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,425
These are all of your
fucking charges right here!

1083
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,677
The IRS, they allow for T&A. It's fine.

1084
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,932
T&E!

1085
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,103
T&E!

1086
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,226
Yeah. I said T&E.

1087
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,602
- No, no. You said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

1088
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,682
Yeah, you did.

1089
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,064
- When did I say that?
- You said T&A. It's T&E.

1090
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,440
I know you're upset about the dinner,

1091
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,820
and that makes sense because we did
spend too much money. But I said T&E.

1092
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,526
Don't tell me what you said.
I heard what you said.

1093
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:42,906
- Dad. He said T&A.
- He did?

1094
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,362
Absolutely, no question.

1095
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:45,571
I'm trying to...

1096
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,701
I'm getting this close!

1097
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:47,998
- Dad, relax.
- I'm getting this close.

1098
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:50,543
That's what I'm saying.
I want you to open up more, Max.

1099
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:51,739
He's gonna fucking kill you.

1100
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,291
Why do you hold it in? Why do you...

1101
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:55,081
Max, why do you hold it in?

1102
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:56,882
That's it. Get the fuck out of here!

1103
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,297
- No, no, no!
- Asshole, get out of here.

1104
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,470
What kind of hooker takes credit cards?

1105
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,592
A rich one.

1106
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,015
At Stratton, there were
three kinds of hookers.

1107
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:07,389
The Blue Chips, top of
the line, model material.

1108
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,970
They cost between $300 and $500

1109
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,852
and you had to wear a condom
unless you gave them a hefty tip,

1110
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,808
which, of course, I always did.

1111
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:17,524
Then came the NASDAQs,
who were pretty, not great.

1112
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,947
They cost between 200 and 300 bucks.

1113
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,491
Finally, there were
the Pink Sheets. Skanks.

1114
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,487
They cost about 100 or less.
If you didn't wear a condom,

1115
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,821
you'd have to get a penicillin shot

1116
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,282
the next day
and pray your dick didn't fall off.

1117
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,208
Not that we didn't fuck them, too.

1118
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,119
Believe me, we did.

1119
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,001
It's that slipped disc thing again.

1120
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,507
I know what it is. You know, too much...

1121
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,338
with EJ Entertainment.

1122
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,419
Pops.

1123
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:42,845
How are things at home?

1124
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,505
Well, not the best.

1125
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,133
She just doesn't...
You know what I'm saying?

1126
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,717
It's like the smell...

1127
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,394
There's a smell,
there's an attraction thing.

1128
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:53,060
After a while it kind of
fades away a little bit.

1129
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,812
Yeah, well. It's supposed to fade away.

1130
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,813
- Supposed to?
- That's marriage. You know...

1131
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,528
Your mother and I, we've been
married a long, long time.

1132
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:00,771
What do you think? We're...

1133
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,698
We're jumping into bed
every two minutes?

1134
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,154
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death.

1135
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,402
I want to stay married, Dad, but...

1136
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:07,828
It's crazy out there.

1137
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,405
Some of these girls...
You should see them.

1138
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,740
Oh, my God!

1139
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,457
They're fucking...

1140
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,410
The things they're doing now, Pops.

1141
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,833
I mean... I mean, it's on
a whole other level.

1142
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,515
- Really?
- And they're all shaved, too.

1143
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,044
- Get out of here!
- All shaven.

1144
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,550
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

1145
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,844
- Bald as a china doll.
- No bush?

1146
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,926
- No bush.
- Oh, my God!

1147
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:29,641
All of a sudden, one week, nobody
had anything down there anymore.

1148
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:30,809
It's a new world.

1149
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,808
They're bald from the eyebrows down.

1150
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,356
- Wow.
- Nothing. Not a stitch. It's like lasers.

1151
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:36,773
Wow. A new world.

1152
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,894
I was born too... Too early.

1153
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,196
I've never been a fan
of the bush, to be honest.

1154
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,606
- Really?
- Yeah.

1155
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:44,781
I don't mind it.

1156
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,275
Dad.

1157
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,740
I don't want you stressing out
about any of this.

1158
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,143
How can I not get stressed out?

1159
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,531
Look at the knuckleheads
you got working for you.

1160
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:52,831
I know they're knuckleheads

1161
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,126
but I need them to want
to live like me, you get it?

1162
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,581
To live like me.

1163
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,044
Jordy.

1164
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:01,883
One of these days, the chickens
are gonna come home to roost.

1165
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,677
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

1166
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:09,135
Crazy? This is obscene.

1167
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:10,762
It was obscene.

1168
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,468
In the normal world.

1169
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,974
But who the fuck wanted to live there?

1170
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,809
Go party your fucking cocks off!

1171
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:25,778
We are about to become
fucking legends

1172
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:27,741
on Wall Street!

1173
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:32,330
We got plans up here
that's gonna take this company

1174
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:35,374
into the fucking stratosphere!

1175
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,121
Wolfie! Wolfie!

1176
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,926
Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them.

1177
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,554
Why should they be taking all our
fucking money all the fucking time?

1178
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:49,801
This way we become the underwriters.

1179
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,427
It was our next big move.

1180
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:55,102
Finding companies to take public. IPOs.

1181
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,975
It was the only way
these Wail Street pricks

1182
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,775
would ever stop thinking of us
as some shitkicker bucket shop.

1183
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,089
We got Arncliffe International.

1184
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,694
See, we were a little different.

1185
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:07,364
We liked to get as fucked up as
possible during our business powwows

1186
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,908
in order to stimulate
our free-flowing ideas,

1187
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:12,988
which is why we were popping
these ludes like they were M&M's.

1188
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:15,164
Steve Madden.

1189
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:17,897
We own the fucking companies...

1190
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:19,706
We own the companies...

1191
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,708
Don't know what a lude is? I'll tell you.

1192
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,838
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1193
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:28,674
Looks like those ludes are working
their magic on Donnie right now.

1194
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,457
The Quaalude,

1195
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:06,461
or lude, as it is commonly referred to,

1196
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,043
was first synthesized in 1951

1197
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,800
by an Indian doctor,
that's dots, not feathers,

1198
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,301
as a sedative,

1199
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,226
and was prescribed to stressed-out
housewives with steep disorders.

1200
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,138
But pretty soon someone figured out

1201
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,975
that if you resisted the urge to sleep
for just 15 minutes,

1202
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,402
you got a pretty kick-ass high from it.

1203
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:30,399
Didn't take long for people
to start abusing ludes, of course.

1204
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:33,655
And in 1982,
the U-S. Government Schedule 1 'd them.

1205
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,907
Along with the rest of the world.

1206
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:39,285
Which meant there was
only a finite amount of these things left.

1207
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,326
No shit, you can't
even buy 'em anymore.

1208
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:44,916
You people are all shit out of luck.

1209
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,501
What are you saying? What is it?

1210
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,752
Steve Madden.

1211
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:49,758
Steve Madden.

1212
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,126
Steve.

1213
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,377
Steve.

1214
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,138
You remember those ads?

1215
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:56,591
Those giant-headed girls
with the bug eyes

1216
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,301
wearing those big clunky shoes?

1217
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,595
My friend from school, Steve Madden.

1218
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,055
His friend from school, Steve Madden.

1219
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,936
Steve Madden was the name
in women's shoes at the moment.

1220
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,736
And all of Wall Street was
begging to take his company public.

1221
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,063
Go ahead, go ahead, what is it?

1222
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,442
Except, guess who grew up with him?

1223
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,320
- Women's shoes.
- Women's shoes.

1224
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:15,948
My very own Vice President.

1225
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:17,619
Women's shoes!

1226
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,788
Diamond Donnie Azoff.

1227
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,454
- Steve Madden.
- Steve.

1228
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:23,876
Steve.

1229
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,043
Hey, JB, JB, JB, JB.

1230
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,291
You gotta come check
this fucking chick out.

1231
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,122
Look at this. Look.

1232
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:36,096
I would fuck that girl
if she was my sister.

1233
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,640
I would let that girl
give me fucking AIDS.

1234
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,427
You want to see the Wolf handle this?

1235
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:44,889
She's hot.

1236
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,727
Cristy.

1237
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,697
Jordan, this is my friend Naomi.

1238
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:56,363
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Naomi.

1239
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:57,989
Naomi, nice to meet you.

1240
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,828
You got an awesome place here.

1241
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,248
I've don't think I've ever been
in a house this big before.

1242
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,494
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1243
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:04,783
Beautiful beach out there.

1244
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,034
Blair Hollingsworth.

1245
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,329
Hi, Blair. Nice to meet you.

1246
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,065
- Your name's Blair, right?
- Yeah.

1247
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,422
You like to Jet Ski?

1248
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,087
I've never done it before.

1249
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,168
You've never Jet Ski'd in your life?

1250
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,252
No, I've never Jet Ski'd.

1251
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,757
You've never been on a Jet Ski?

1252
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:18,009
How many times
are you gonna ask her?

1253
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,465
She's never been on a Jet Ski.

1254
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:22,180
I don't know.
Might ask her a couple more times.

1255
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:24,846
Okay. Sure.

1256
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:27,769
Hi. I'm Hildy. Nice to meet you.

1257
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,850
- Hi.
- Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

1258
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,355
Yeah, I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

1259
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:32,778
Just tell her I'll be
out in a couple of minutes.

1260
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,321
Why don't you tell your wife that?

1261
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,397
I might do that, but I'm having

1262
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:37,028
- a conversation right now.
- What am I, your secretary?

1263
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,950
You know what,
I think we should get going.

1264
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,198
Wait, wait. Where you guys going?

1265
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,741
We gotta go.
We got two other parties to go to.

1266
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,497
- We can stay for a drink.
- Yeah, stay for a drink.

1267
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,942
No. We got two other parties
we're supposed to get to.

1268
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,191
But we can stay for a drink...

1269
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,373
She's

1270
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,212
perfect.

1271
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,831
- You like champagne?
- I do.

1272
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:52,961
She's perfect.

1273
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,480
Donnie, what the fuck are you doing?

1274
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,218
You piece of...

1275
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,512
You're gonna have
to excuse my friend. He gets...

1276
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:07,976
Get the fuck out!

1277
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,103
Jordan, you gotta fuck her, bro.
She's so hot!

1278
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,271
Yeah, Donnie!

1279
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,357
Let him fucking finish, Hildy.

1280
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,063
That's fucking rude.

1281
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,985
Have some fucking manners.

1282
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,954
So, Bay Ridge,
that's near Staten Island, right?

1283
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:26,369
Brooklyn, across the Verrazano Bridge.

1284
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:28,037
Saturday Night Fever territory.

1285
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,660
That's right. Guinea Gulch.

1286
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,041
We call the Verrazano Bridge
the Guinea Gangplank.

1287
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,212
Right.

1288
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,915
So I presume you're Italian?

1289
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,215
On my dad's side.

1290
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,511
I'm also Dutch, German, English.

1291
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,092
I'm a mutt.

1292
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,593
Yeah. You're a mutt.

1293
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,009
Yeah, I still have family
over there though, in London.

1294
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:47,811
My Aunt Emma. She's the best.

1295
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,856
Very British, you know.
She's a classy lady.

1296
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,274
That explains it then.

1297
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,350
Explains what?

1298
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,232
It explains you. I mean,
you're a duchess, right?

1299
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,731
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

1300
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,863
Excuse me.

1301
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:04,945
Could I get a straw, please?

1302
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,581
Thank you.

1303
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:15,833
So I was a little surprised
you asked Cristy for my number.

1304
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:18,167
Why is that?

1305
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,883
Aren't you married?

1306
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,428
Well... Yeah, but what?

1307
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,601
Married people can't have friends?

1308
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,267
We're gonna be friends?

1309
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,567
Yeah. You don't want to be my friend?

1310
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,733
We're not gonna be friends.

1311
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,459
And at night I work on my designs.

1312
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,249
I have an entire line of lingerie.

1313
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:58,208
You know, camisoles, bustiers, panties.

1314
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,635
She designs women's panties, too?

1315
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,428
Oh, my God!

1316
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,399
Come on, Jordan, think of a way
to get up to her apartment.

1317
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,990
You wanna come up for
some tea or something?

1318
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,952
Tea? Yeah.

1319
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,946
- Like hot tea?
- Yeah.

1320
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,350
Oh, yeah. That sounds nice. Yeah.

1321
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,708
Tea. Fuck, yeah, I wanted
to come up for tea.

1322
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,745
Like Darjeeling or rose hip,
something nice like that?

1323
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:36,954
Sure.

1324
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,380
This is Rocky.

1325
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,674
Oh, who's this? Say hi, Rocky.

1326
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,008
Hi, sweetheart.

1327
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,384
Okay.

1328
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:46,547
Why don't you light a fire or something
and I'll be right out.

1329
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,928
- Yeah. Fire, here?
- Sure.

1330
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:53,891
I like your painting here. It's...

1331
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,648
God, help me. How do I fuck this girl?

1332
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,284
You all right?

1333
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,704
Yeah, yeah. Just trying
to light the fire here.

1334
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,912
That's it. That's it, you're leaving.

1335
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,872
Don't get involved.
Go home to your wife.

1336
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,683
As you can probably guess,

1337
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,307
I fucked her goddamn brains out...

1338
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,146
Jesus Lord!

1339
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:40,601
For 11 seconds.

1340
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:52,992
Did you just come?

1341
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:55,036
Oh, yeah, I just came.

1342
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,417
Did you? Did you come?

1343
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,210
- No.
- No?

1344
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:00,378
Okay.

1345
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,623
I'm still hard so just give me a sec.

1346
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,133
Sure.

1347
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,044
Come on, baby, come on.

1348
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,765
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1349
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,014
Oh, God!

1350
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,024
Fuck off, Rocky! Bad dog.

1351
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,521
You have a biscuit
or something like that?

1352
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:23,693
It's okay.

1353
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,237
- Just keep going.
- Rocky, go play.

1354
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,189
Go play, Rocky. Go, go, go. go.

1355
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,072
You're crazy.

1356
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,403
I couldn't get enough.

1357
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:34,830
I mean, her pussy
was like heroin to me.

1358
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,658
And it wasn't just about the sex, either.

1359
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,743
Naomi and I got along. I mean, we...

1360
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,669
We had similar interests and shit.

1361
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,627
Choo-choo train.

1362
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,011
Yeah.

1363
00:59:57,177 --> 01:00:00,898
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

1364
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:10,195
Yeah, yeah.
Let's toke it all on there, huh?

1365
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,402
Oh, shit!

1366
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,167
You!

1367
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:27,295
Get out of the fucking car!

1368
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:28,713
Jesus Christ.

1369
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,386
Son of a bitch! Oh, fuck!

1370
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,472
Relax, sweetheart. Relax.

1371
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,267
- Son of a fucking bitch!
- Okay, okay... Geez!

1372
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,639
Okay, babe, stop!

1373
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,844
Please.

1374
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:41,020
Bitch!

1375
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:43,390
- What are you doing...
- That whore from the party?

1376
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,975
Jesus Christ!

1377
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,150
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1378
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:47,478
I thought you were at the fucking beach!

1379
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,904
I didn't know you were here!

1380
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,526
That's where you've fucking been?

1381
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:52,323
With that fucking whore from the party?

1382
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:53,821
I thought you were at the beach house.

1383
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,277
How could you do this to me?

1384
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,159
- Sweetie, come on...
- Who the fuck are you, Jordan?

1385
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,991
You're like a completely
different fucking person!

1386
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:04,203
I made a mistake.
I don't know what to tell you, babe. I...

1387
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:05,920
I'm sorry.

1388
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,878
- I'm sorry.
- Is that who... Is that what you want?

1389
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:20,431
Do you love her?

1390
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,567
Answer me.

1391
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:51,212
I felt horrible.

1392
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:54,051
Three days later, I filed for a divorce

1393
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,879
and moved Naomi into the apartment.

1394
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:03,892
Say what you will,
but the Duchess did have style.

1395
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:07,099
She brought in a decorator,
feng shui'd the whole place.

1396
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:09,560
She even hired a gay butler.

1397
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:12,237
This guy was smart,
sophisticated, professional.

1398
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:13,905
Really, really great.

1399
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,319
Is that jasmine?

1400
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,318
Yes, sir. I tried to stump you
this evening. Very good.

1401
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,279
Very good. Great nose.

1402
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:22,035
Except for that one time.

1403
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,704
Oh, my God!

1404
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,673
Oh, hey.

1405
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,425
Is it Wednesday already?

1406
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:35,628
Oh, don't stop.

1407
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:36,802
What the fuck!

1408
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,006
That is fucked up!

1409
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,681
He must have thought we were still

1410
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,350
at the Hamptons
this weekend, you know.

1411
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:43,802
Where were they doing it,
sweetheart? In the bedroom?

1412
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,559
They were everywhere. There were
two guys over there on the table.

1413
01:02:46,638 --> 01:02:47,890
There were more over here.

1414
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,441
There were four right here.

1415
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,189
Are you fucking serious? Right there?

1416
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:54,112
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, baby, it gets worse.

1417
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:58,154
After they left, I checked the apartment.

1418
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,367
Right. What?

1419
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:01,536
What is it, babe? What?

1420
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:02,953
Where's my money?

1421
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,030
I don't know where your money...

1422
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,116
Where is my fucking money?
Where is it?

1423
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,167
I don't know where
your money is, Mr. Belfort.

1424
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:10,496
- I didn't do anything.
- If you don't get...

1425
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:11,875
He's lying through his fucking teeth.

1426
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:13,195
Let's start from the beginning.

1427
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,458
Let's start from the beginning, all right?

1428
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,088
You invited some friends over, right?

1429
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,049
One thing led to another.
Things got out of hand.

1430
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,630
We understand that, we do.

1431
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:22,136
We do blow all the time.
We're fucking degenerates ourselves.

1432
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,307
Look at us, right?

1433
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:24,976
But money was stolen
from my apartment.

1434
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,644
Right from my sock drawer. All right?

1435
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,814
Like I said, I don't know
where your money is.

1436
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,265
Just start from the beginning.
Who came over?

1437
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,395
It was just a normal day.

1438
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,817
I knew you were coming home
the next day.

1439
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,145
So everything would be fine.
It'd be cleaned up.

1440
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,151
I got a little high at breakfast.

1441
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,028
So I got a little happy. I had some eggs,

1442
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:40,108
I had a little bit of ice cream.

1443
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,034
And then I said,
"Who do I know that likes ice cream?"

1444
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,578
It's my friend, Rudy. So I called Rudy.

1445
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,122
- Who's Rudy?
- Yeah, who's Rudy?

1446
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:51,002
- You know who Rudy is. Come on.
- Me? I don't...

1447
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,203
- You know...
- Who the fuck is Rudy?

1448
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:53,334
I don't know anyone named Rudy.

1449
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:54,505
Last month. The Lollipop Club.

1450
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,049
You know who Rudy was. Dancing...

1451
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:57,546
You know who Rudy is?

1452
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,629
I don't fucking know any...

1453
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:01,679
What do you mean?

1454
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:02,847
So he went to The Lollipop Club?

1455
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,523
Oh, he was
at The Lollipop Club for sure.

1456
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,184
On the stage, grinding with everybody.

1457
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,261
I got fucked up. I like to dance.

1458
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,888
I don't know.
Maybe I met him, maybe I didn't.

1459
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,598
I meet a lot of fucking people.

1460
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,353
- What are you saying?
- $50,000 was stolen

1461
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:14,650
from my fucking sock drawer!

1462
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:16,228
All my girlfriend's jewelry is gone.

1463
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,234
- Where the fuck is it?
- ...Rudy. What the fuck?

1464
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:20,361
Did your fucking little faggot
friend Rudy take my shit?

1465
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,113
Did he? Answer me!

1466
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:24,695
Okay. Now I get it. Now I get why I'm...

1467
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:25,995
This is a gay thing.

1468
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:27,664
See, all of you...

1469
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,509
You think this is 'cause you're a fag?

1470
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,418
My cousin's a fucking faggot.

1471
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:33,893
And I go on vacation with him
and his boyfriend. I love fags.

1472
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,079
You were in charge, right?

1473
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,881
I will not be stolen from. You get that?

1474
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:39,129
I fucking like gay people.
I don't like you.

1475
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,930
He should've hired a fucking Mexican
like I have in my fucking house.

1476
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,056
Shit! What the fuck...

1477
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,645
Talk, you fuck, talk!

1478
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,846
I'm gonna drop you, you faggot!

1479
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,102
Where is it?

1480
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:56,318
Chester and Toby,
they went all yakuza on Nicholas.

1481
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:57,485
You know, they got crazy.

1482
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,607
I don't know!

1483
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,319
I had to call the cops just to keep
them from killing the poor guy.

1484
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,035
I gave them each 1,000 bucks
and told them what Nicholas had done.

1485
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,696
Then they kicked his ass.

1486
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,531
Thanks again, Officer.

1487
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:12,538
It's not like I cared about
the 50 grand anyway.

1488
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:14,244
I was making that much
almost every day

1489
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,580
through one rathole or another.

1490
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:19,416
Now a rathole is a friend,
like Brad here,

1491
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:22,048
who held stock in his name for me.

1492
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,387
Who are you supposed to be, huh?
Jack Nickle-Jew?

1493
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:29,263
I'd drive the price up then he'd sell
and kick most of the profits back to...

1494
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,185
You guessed it, me.

1495
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,479
All cash. None of it's on the books.

1496
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,856
A big no-no, of course,
in the eyes of the law.

1497
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:42,864
Enter our new securities
attorney, Manny Riskin.

1498
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,614
700 bucks an hour
to be the voice of doom.

1499
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:48,445
Listen to me. You piss up the SEC's leg,

1500
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:49,745
you end up with your tits in a ringer.

1501
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:52,825
Do not worry about it.
I have the SEC under control.

1502
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,668
What the fuck
are these imbeciles doing?

1503
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:57,128
Hey! Hey!

1504
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,500
What are you doing? Hey!

1505
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,540
We got the SEC in here.

1506
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,709
The Securities
and Exchange Commission

1507
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,386
sent two lawyers down
to review our files.

1508
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,385
So I set them up in our conference room

1509
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,556
and I had it bugged

1510
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,850
and the air conditioning
turned up so high

1511
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,472
that it felt like Antarctica in there.

1512
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:14,520
Is it always this cold in here?

1513
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:15,643
I don't know.

1514
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:16,894
Then, while they were looking

1515
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,395
for a smoking gun in that room...

1516
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,273
Arncliffe International is on fire.

1517
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,605
I was gonna fire off a bazooka in here,

1518
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:25,941
offering up our latest IPO.

1519
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:28,527
An IPO is an initial public offering.

1520
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:32,365
It's the first time a stock is offered
for sale to the general population.

1521
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:34,324
Now, as the firm taking
the company public,

1522
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,080
we set the initial sales price

1523
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,912
then sold those shares
right back to our friends. The...

1524
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:40,630
Look.

1525
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:42,590
I know you're not following
what I'm saying anyway, right?

1526
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,630
That's okay. That doesn't matter.

1527
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,552
The real question is this.

1528
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:48,505
"Was all this legal?"

1529
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:50,465
Absolutely fucking not.

1530
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,263
But we were making more money
than we knew what to do with.

1531
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:58,765
And what do you do when you're making

1532
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,449
more money
than you know what to do with?

1533
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,736
Oh, my God!

1534
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:09,780
Will you marry me?

1535
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:11,661
Oh, my God.

1536
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,738
Is that a yes?

1537
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,494
Are you sure?

1538
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,450
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure.

1539
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,502
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1540
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:33,391
I held my bachelor party
at the Mirage in Las Vegas.

1541
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:35,852
The ﬂight there alone was a bacchanal.

1542
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:40,060
One last blowout for the gods
before I settled down for good.

1543
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,895
A hundred Strattonites,

1544
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,774
50 hookers, plus 50 more waiting
once we landed.

1545
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:46,479
Oh, and the drugs.

1546
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:50,409
I mean, I tell you, our plane was
like a pharmacy with wings.

1547
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:23,191
Al! Told, the weekend
cost me two million bucks,

1548
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:28,271
including the cost
of refurbishing the entire 28th ﬂoor.

1549
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,191
kiss the bride.

1550
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:36,245
But the wedding
was something out of a fairytale.

1551
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,407
With Naomi, my Duchess,

1552
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:40,992
me, her handsome Duke,

1553
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:44,124
and The Bahamas Ocean Club,
our castle.

1554
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,843
Of course, after the bachelor party,
me, the Duke,

1555
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,678
needed a few penicillin shots
so he could

1556
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:02,890
safely consummate the marriage.

1557
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,067
Hey! Barry Kleinman,
filming the wedding.

1558
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,568
A few words for your son?

1559
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:14,317
Jordan. Remember what I told you.

1560
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,529
It involves your penis and her vagina.

1561
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:20,582
And you know, you know
what you can do, Jordy.

1562
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,388
Oh, my God!

1563
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:40,844
Aunt Emma?

1564
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,933
I can't believe you came!

1565
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:50,607
Jordan! Jordan! Look who came!

1566
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:52,443
It's Aunt Emma.

1567
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:54,607
Aunt Emma.

1568
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:57,076
- Oh, Jordan, dear, how lovely.
- Hey, how you doing?

1569
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:00,618
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you in person.

1570
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,623
Into the donuts, I see.

1571
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:05,043
Oh, I... l...

1572
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,335
Well...

1573
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,464
I lived through the '60s, my dear.

1574
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,007
Enjoy the day.

1575
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:13,505
She surprised me. I didn't even know.

1576
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,354
Just one more step. Are you ready?

1577
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:31,027
- Where are we going?
- Keep your eyes closed.

1578
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:32,479
One, two, three!

1579
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:36,031
What is this?

1580
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:38,158
- It's your wedding present.
- What?

1581
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,754
It's your wedding present, sweetheart.

1582
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:42,405
What?

1583
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:44,992
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

1584
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,200
A fucking yacht?

1585
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:49,204
For millionaires
whose ships have come in,

1586
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:52,086
pricey pleasure boats
are for the most fun afloat.

1587
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:55,260
It's no coincidence that
its 150 feet of green hull

1588
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,507
is the color of cash. Anchors aweigh!

1589
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,840
Oh, my God! Baby!

1590
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:03,802
- I think you like it?
- You're crazy.

1591
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:05,307
- You like it?
- Yes!

1592
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,774
For three weeks, we sailed
the Naomi through the Caribbean,

1593
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,855
eventually taking her home
to Long Island,

1594
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,030
where we bought a house.

1595
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,700
Seven acres on
the Gold Coast of Long Island.

1596
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:22,286
The most expensive
real estate in the world.

1597
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:25,035
With maids, cooks, landscapers,
you name it.

1598
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:27,583
We even had two guards
who worked in shifts.

1599
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,747
Both named Rocco.

1600
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:34,966
It was heaven on earth.

1601
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,303
Wake up, you piece of shit!

1602
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,093
Who's Venice?

1603
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:42,515
- Huh?
"Who?

1604
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:43,591
Who? Who?

1605
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:45,347
"Who?" What are you, a fucking owl?

1606
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:46,598
Who is she?

1607
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,141
Some little hooker
you were fucking last night?

1608
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,144
What the fuck are
you talking about? No.

1609
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,816
No way, baby, no!

1610
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:54,235
You were calling
her name in your sleep!

1611
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,938
Are you out of your
fucking mind? I don't...

1612
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,153
I don't even know who Venice is.

1613
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:01,451
What the fuck does that
even mean? Venice.

1614
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:04,279
That's the stupidest shit
I've ever heard in my fucking life!

1615
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,247
Venice...

1616
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,837
Venice, baby, where are you?

1617
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:14,835
Venice!

1618
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:17,042
Venice!

1619
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:18,838
Where'd you go?

1620
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:25,675
Oh, baby.
Oh, you're gonna play rough, huh?

1621
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,931
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- You like that?

1622
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,391
I like it. I like it.

1623
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:34,275
Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie.

1624
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,476
Wolfie?

1625
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,857
Yeah, it's my safe word, baby.
It's my safe word.

1626
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,358
I don't give a fuck about your safe word!

1627
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,531
- Come on!
- Shut the fuck up!

1628
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,984
Shut up, you little bitch!

1629
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,570
You're a fucking dirty little birdy!

1630
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:48,660
That's right.

1631
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,033
That's right! I forgot.

1632
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:51,625
I forgot, baby.

1633
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:56,043
Donnie and I were investing
in a condominium complex in Venice.

1634
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,322
That's why all this confusion.

1635
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:58,878
Oh, you're investing in Italy?

1636
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,676
Not Italy. California.

1637
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,253
- Oh, California?
- Yeah.

1638
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:03,496
You're a lying piece of shit!

1639
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:04,718
Duchess, baby, come on.

1640
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,344
Don't you fucking "Duchess" me.

1641
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:07,887
Don't you "Duchess" me!

1642
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:11,104
Do you really think that
I don't know what you're up to?

1643
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,097
- You're a father now, Jordan.
- Yeah.

1644
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,602
- You're a father now.
- I know...

1645
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:16,400
And you're still acting like an infant!

1646
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,357
God damn it!

1647
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:22,111
Baby, you know,
you got real anger issues.

1648
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:24,530
Who is the one who flew in here

1649
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:27,488
at 3:00 in the morning
on their stupid helicopter

1650
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,618
and woke up Skylar? That was you!

1651
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:32,325
Oh, Skylar! Oh, fucking bullshit!

1652
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:47,140
Does it even matter to you
that I just had that driving range

1653
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,435
sodded with Bermuda grass, Jordan,

1654
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:52,557
- and now you fucking wrecked it!
- Oh, my God... Bermuda grass.

1655
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,389
No, you didn't research the whole thing

1656
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,566
and deal with the fucking
golf course people!

1657
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:57,813
Oh, my God,

1658
01:13:57,892 --> 01:14:00,441
you had to deal
with the golf course people, too!

1659
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:03,193
What a Greek tragedy, honey!
Oh, my God!

1660
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:06,193
You probably had to pay them
in cash with your hands!

1661
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,492
What a fucking burden.

1662
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,536
And actually do some work
besides swiping

1663
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,740
my fucking credit card all day, huh?

1664
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:14,541
Because I can't keep track
of your professions, honey.

1665
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,494
'Cause last month
you were a wine connoisseur.

1666
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:18,625
Now you're an aspiring
landscape architect!

1667
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:20,377
- Let me get that right... No!
- Fuck you!

1668
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,458
Don't fucking dare throw that

1669
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,010
fucking water at me.
Don't you fucking dare.

1670
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,388
All right, honey?

1671
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:28,972
Now will you just...

1672
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:30,925
We could talk this out, all right?

1673
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:33,386
We just use our words. You know?

1674
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,561
Communicate.

1675
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:35,854
Okay?

1676
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,686
Come on, sweetheart.

1677
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,733
Talk to me. Talk to me.

1678
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,898
Stop flexing your muscles, Jordan.

1679
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,696
You look like a fucking imbecile.

1680
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:45,068
Babe, come on.

1681
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:48,318
You should feel happy
you got a husband

1682
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:50,654
who's in such great shape
like this, huh?

1683
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,696
Come here.

1684
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,327
Come on, give me a kiss.

1685
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:55,454
You look so beautiful right now.

1686
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:56,666
- Come on.
- Kiss you?

1687
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:57,914
- You look so beautiful...
- Kiss you?

1688
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,621
Yeah, give me one...

1689
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:01,922
Fuck you!

1690
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:04,000
Ah, yes, my morning ritual.

1691
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,468
First I'd get up and fight with Naomi

1692
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:08,763
about whatever it is
I did the night before.

1693
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:11,057
Next was a steam so I could sweat out

1694
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:12,884
the drugs still in my system.

1695
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:14,594
Then I'd assess the damage.

1696
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,596
Drown out my eyeballs.

1697
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,231
Take my "back pills"
to get the day started,

1698
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:21,400
then seek to make up with Naomi.

1699
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:23,440
Good morning, Daddy.

1700
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,613
Where's my kiss?

1701
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:29,067
Hey, sweetheart.

1702
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,830
Does Daddy get a kiss from
both of his little girls, huh?

1703
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,289
Oh, no.

1704
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:38,459
No, Daddy doesn't even
get to touch Mommy

1705
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,286
for a very, Very.

1706
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,129
Very long time.

1707
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:45,416
Daddy's really sorry
about what he said in the other room.

1708
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:46,716
He didn't mean any of it.

1709
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:49,090
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1710
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:51,221
And from now on,

1711
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:54,804
it's gonna be nothing but short,

1712
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:57,228
short skirts around the house.

1713
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:02,316
And you know something else, Daddy?

1714
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:09,407
Mommy is just so sick
and tired of wearing panties.

1715
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:13,160
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1716
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:16,951
In fact,

1717
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:21,702
she's decided to throw them

1718
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:25,006
all away.

1719
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:32,672
So take a good look, Daddy.

1720
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:36,138
You're gonna be seeing
an awful lot of this around the house.

1721
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:37,764
Oh, baby...

1722
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:39,311
Yeah, Mommy.

1723
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:41,727
- Yeah...
- But no touching.

1724
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,895
Oh, gosh.

1725
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:50,113
What's wrong, Daddy?

1726
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:51,532
Baby.

1727
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:54,868
God!

1728
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:57,701
Look at this shit.

1729
01:16:57,822 --> 01:17:01,543
Okay. Mommy likes to
play games with Daddy.

1730
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:07,878
Mommy, have you ever noticed
anything odd about Mr...

1731
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:09,925
Mr. Fuzzy Bear over there?

1732
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:15,215
His eyes seem
to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1733
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:19,184
Yeah, there's something
a little bit different about his eyes.

1734
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:22,480
Yes! I think it's true. Say "Hi," Mommy.

1735
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,398
Say "Hi" to Rocco and Rocco.

1736
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:25,816
Say "Hi." Hi, fellas.

1737
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:27,310
See that, huh?

1738
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:29,145
Of all the fucking days,

1739
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:30,980
she chooses today
to give me blue balls!

1740
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:34,150
I mean, today was
the biggest day in Stratton's history,

1741
01:17:34,233 --> 01:17:36,076
and I needed to be thinking straight.

1742
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,574
Hey, Jordan!

1743
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,746
- Welcome.
- Steve here yet?

1744
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:42,951
This was the day that
we launched the Steve Madden IPO.

1745
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:45,197
Troops are all here,
everyone's all rallied, excited.

1746
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:47,042
Everything had to run tight.

1747
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,168
It had to be perfect.

1748
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:50,420
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1749
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:52,092
What's he doing?

1750
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:54,670
The biggest IPO in this firm's history.

1751
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:57,052
What the fuck is he doing?

1752
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,058
Is he... Is he wearing a bow tie?

1753
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,434
Hi.

1754
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:03,687
How're you doing?

1755
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:04,763
Good.

1756
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,479
You cleaning the fish bowl?

1757
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:10,653
I just... I had a minute and...

1758
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:12,438
You had a minute.

1759
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,074
And today you needed
to clean the fish bowl? Today?

1760
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:18,824
I had finished my paperwork
and I had a couple of minutes.

1761
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:20,784
Okay. Nice to meet you.

1762
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:28,037
On new issue day?

1763
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,299
On cocksucking,
motherfucking new issue day?

1764
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:33,588
This is what you do?

1765
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,549
Hey, everybody, listen up!

1766
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:39,812
This is what happens when you fuck
with your pets on new issue day!

1767
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,322
Take your little bow tie, get your shit,

1768
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,491
and get the fuck out of my office!
You understand?

1769
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,068
Get the fuck out!

1770
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,240
Everybody on point!

1771
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:07,247
We are here to make money.
Everybody on point.

1772
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:12,498
A real wolf pit,
which is exactly how I liked it.

1773
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,209
Jordan, look what I caught in the lobby.
I caught a genius.

1774
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:16,756
Enter Steve Madden.

1775
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:17,969
The great American cobbler.

1776
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:20,423
Red-hot ladies footwear impresario.

1777
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:24,094
And thanks to Donnie,
we were taking his company public.

1778
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:27,897
Stratton Oakmont was crawling out
of the primordial ooze.

1779
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,978
Pond scum no more.

1780
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:31,604
That's why they gotta see your face.

1781
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:34,153
You get them fired up so they push
the shit out of this stock. Okay?

1782
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:36,822
And not only that,
Donnie and I secretly owned

1783
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:39,195
85% of Steve Madden Shoes,

1784
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,777
which legally speaking was a big no-no,

1785
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:45,239
but we'd get filthy fucking rich
if our troops got behind it.

1786
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:47,825
Our job was to get them worked up.

1787
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,710
But not too worked up.

1788
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,497
Hello. If...

1789
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,712
For those of you who don't know me...

1790
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,047
My name's Steve Madden.

1791
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:58,673
Yeah, we know who you are.

1792
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:00,258
Your name is on the box.

1793
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,009
Get the shoes. Show them the shoes.

1794
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:03,682
- Show them the shoes.
- Okay. Yeah.

1795
01:20:03,966 --> 01:20:06,970
Anyway, you know,
this shoe is pretty cool.

1796
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:09,896
This is the Mary Lou, which is really
the shoe that put me on the map.

1797
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,565
Without it, I wouldn't be here.

1798
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,812
It's a fat girls' shoe!

1799
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:14,859
Believe it or not...
Believe it or not though,

1800
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:18,277
the Mary Lou is actually the same
as the Mary Jane, but it's black leather.

1801
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,612
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1802
01:20:24,695 --> 01:20:27,574
Fight back! Come on!
Where you at? Where you at?

1803
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,162
All right!

1804
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:32,495
Let's give it up for Steve Madden
and his awesome Mary Lou!

1805
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:34,751
Hold that up. Hold that up.
Hold that up proud!

1806
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,299
Give him a round of applause!

1807
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,628
You guys got that
out of your systems, huh?

1808
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,589
You having a good afternoon or what?

1809
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:47,180
I wanna take a moment
and tell you why Steve here is so

1810
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,557
absolutely off the fucking wall.

1811
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:54,358
It's because this man
is a creative genius.

1812
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:58,437
This ability, this gift that Steve has,

1813
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:01,862
it goes beyond just
spotting the hottest shoe trends.

1814
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,695
Steve's power is that he creates trends.

1815
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:07,450
You understand?

1816
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,748
Artists like Steve
come along once every decade.

1817
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:13,248
I'm talking Giorgio Armani,
Gianni Versace, Coco Chanel,

1818
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:14,954
Yves Saint Laurent.

1819
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:17,039
Steve, come over here for a second.

1820
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,291
I don't think you all realize

1821
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:21,335
that Steve Madden

1822
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:24,968
is the hottest person
in the women's shoe industry,

1823
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:26,408
with orders going through the roof

1824
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:29,768
at every department store
in North America right now.

1825
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,262
We have him here in our office!

1826
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:36,104
We should thank
our fucking lucky stars this man is here!

1827
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:38,777
We should be on our hands
and knees right now,

1828
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:40,946
getting ready to suck this guy off!

1829
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:43,570
Like this! Okay?

1830
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:45,443
I wanna suck you off, Steve!

1831
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:47,911
Everyone's gonna suck you off!

1832
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:49,781
This is our golden ticket

1833
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:52,286
to the fucking chocolate
factory right here!

1834
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,326
And I wanna meet

1835
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,666
Willy fucking Wonka, okay?

1836
01:21:57,329 --> 01:22:00,173
I wanna be with the fucking
Oompa Loompas like this!

1837
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:06,676
All right, get off this fucking stage!
Get out of here.

1838
01:22:07,214 --> 01:22:09,558
All right, I want all of you
to focus for a second.

1839
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:12,094
See those little black boxes?

1840
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:13,436
They're called telephones.

1841
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:16,265
I'm gonna let you in on a little
secret about these telephones.

1842
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:18,942
They're not gonna dial
themselves. Okay?

1843
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:22,780
Without you, they're just
worthless hunks of plastic.

1844
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:26,992
Like a loaded M16 without
a trained Marine to pull the trigger.

1845
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:30,449
And in the case of the telephone,

1846
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:33,240
it's up to each and every one of you,

1847
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,835
my highly-trained Strattonites.

1848
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,250
My killers!

1849
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:43,297
My killers, who will not
take no for an answer!

1850
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:45,756
My fucking warriors,

1851
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,213
who will not hang up the phone

1852
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:51,301
until their client either buys

1853
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,556
or fucking dies!

1854
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:10,114
Let me tell you something.

1855
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:13,198
There is no nobility in poverty.

1856
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,659
I have been a rich man
and I have been a poor man.

1857
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:19,165
And I choose rich every fucking time.

1858
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:23,086
Because at least as a rich man,
when I have to face my problems,

1859
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:27,011
I show up in the back of a limo,
wearing a $2,000 suit

1860
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:29,679
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!

1861
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:35,018
Duke it out! Hit him!

1862
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:36,515
Get the fuck off me!

1863
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:42,147
And if anyone here thinks
I'm superficial or materialistic,

1864
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:44,520
go get a job at fucking McDonald's,

1865
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:46,605
'cause that's where you fucking belong!

1866
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:52,282
But before you depart
this room full of winners,

1867
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:56,165
I want you to take a good look
at the person next to you. Go on.

1868
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:59,410
Because sometime in
the not-so-distant future,

1869
01:23:59,826 --> 01:24:03,296
you're gonna be pulling up to a red light
in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,

1870
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:06,671
and that person's gonna be
pulling up right alongside you

1871
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,878
in their brand new Porsche

1872
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:11,713
with their beautiful wife by their side,

1873
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,799
who's got big voluptuous tits.

1874
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:17,720
And who're you gonna be sitting next to?

1875
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:21,103
Some disgusting wildebeest
with three days of razor-stubble,

1876
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:22,524
in a sleeveless muumuu,

1877
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:24,977
crammed in next to you
in a carload full of groceries

1878
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,812
from the fucking Price Club!

1879
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:29,193
That's who you're gonna
be sitting next to!

1880
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:31,526
So you listen to me and you listen well.

1881
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,869
Are you behind on your credit card bills?

1882
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:36,451
Good! Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1883
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:39,412
Is your landlord ready
to evict you? Good!

1884
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,873
Pick up the phone and start dialing!

1885
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:45,248
Does your girlfriend think
you're a fucking worthless loser?

1886
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:48,379
Good! Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1887
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:52,004
I want you to deal with your problems
by becoming rich!

1888
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:57,472
All you have to do today
is pick up that phone

1889
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:01,521
and speak the words
that I have taught you.

1890
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,773
And I will make you richer

1891
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:06,939
than the most powerful CEO
in the United States of fucking America!

1892
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:08,191
Yeah!

1893
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:10,606
Fuck, yeah!

1894
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:13,325
I want you to go out there

1895
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:15,865
and I want you to ram

1896
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:19,448
Steve Madden stock
down your clients' throats

1897
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:21,829
until they fucking choke on it!

1898
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:26,497
Till they choke on it and they buy
100,000 shares! That's what I want.

1899
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,127
Yeah! Fuck, yeah.

1900
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:29,833
You be ferocious!

1901
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,885
- You be relentless!
- Yeah!

1902
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,260
You be telephone fucking terrorists!

1903
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:40,310
Now let's knock this motherfucker
out of the park!

1904
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:15,346
At 1:00 p.m., we opened
the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.

1905
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:18,553
By 1:03, it was over $18.

1906
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:20,972
Even the big Wall Street
firms were buying.

1907
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:32,817
Of the two million shares
offered for sale,

1908
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:35,866
a million belonged to me,
held in phony accounts by my ratholes.

1909
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:38,114
Now once the price hit the high teens...

1910
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:40,404
You know what? Who gives a shit?

1911
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:42,455
As always, the point is this.

1912
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:46,952
$22 million in three fucking hours!

1913
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,963
Can you believe this shit?

1914
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:52,466
- I fucking love this, baby!
- It's amazing!

1915
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,963
Jordan!

1916
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:55,381
Barry Kleinman's on the phone

1917
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,087
- from Future Video.
- Who?

1918
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,387
I don't know. He shot at your wedding.

1919
01:26:58,463 --> 01:26:59,510
He says it's urgent.

1920
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:01,725
Urgent? Who the fuck
is Barry Kleinman?

1921
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,393
Oh, my God, you wanna marry me?

1922
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:04,515
You're in love with me?

1923
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:05,641
Yeah. Go fuck your cousin!

1924
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:06,763
Hey, Barry, what's up?

1925
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:08,975
Listen, I got this subpoena.

1926
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:10,525
Subpoena? What the fuck
are you talking about?

1927
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,228
Yeah, the FBI, they want
a copy of your wedding video.

1928
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:14,483
The fucking FBI?

1929
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,531
- You fucking kidding me?
- Listen to me.

1930
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:17,903
His name is Denham.

1931
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,656
He's an agent with the New York office.

1932
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:20,782
What's his problem?

1933
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:23,489
He's a Boy Scout.
He thinks you're fucking Gordon Gekko.

1934
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:26,033
What does he want
with my wedding video?

1935
01:27:26,116 --> 01:27:27,743
It's like an invasion of my privacy.

1936
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,169
You know what I'm saying? It's like...

1937
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:30,583
It's intrusive, you know.

1938
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:33,336
He's got pictures of your
whole inner fucking circle.

1939
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:35,258
Pictures, names of the people.

1940
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:36,334
You know what he's trying to do?

1941
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:37,544
Exactly what he's doing.
Look at yourself.

1942
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:38,841
He's trying to rattle you,

1943
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,422
he's trying to rattle your old lady,

1944
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:43,224
so she nags you until
you become a fucking witness.

1945
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,768
He wants me to rat on myself?

1946
01:27:44,843 --> 01:27:46,641
He wants me to
give information about my...

1947
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:48,559
Listen. The good fucking news is,

1948
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:50,436
you know I know everybody downtown,

1949
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:52,734
I call up the Justice Department,
the DEA,

1950
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:55,904
nobody even knows you fucking exist,
so calm down!

1951
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:57,405
They don't know I exist?

1952
01:27:57,689 --> 01:27:59,316
- No.
- That's good.

1953
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:05,368
But you...

1954
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:06,915
You know who he is, right?

1955
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:09,625
- Yeah.
- So, if I just wanted to get

1956
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,701
some more information,
just find out what he knows,

1957
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:14,965
you could go to his house, right?

1958
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,917
Tap his phones a little bit, bug him.

1959
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,126
You could get some information...

1960
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:21,009
You don't fuck with these guys like that.

1961
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:22,179
You don't fuck with them like that.

1962
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:23,427
What are you, nuts or something?

1963
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:25,134
This is what you fucking do.
What do I pay you for?

1964
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:28,312
I have a fucking P.l. license, you know?
I make a living at this.

1965
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:29,478
I'm not a cop anymore.

1966
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:31,556
They'll take my fucking license
away from me, all right?

1967
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:32,732
Okay.

1968
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:35,686
Okay, if I can't do that, can I just...

1969
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:37,229
Can I give the guy a call?

1970
01:28:38,438 --> 01:28:40,440
- Why? Is that...
- Jordan. Jordan.

1971
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:41,525
Do me a favor?

1972
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:44,532
The only one who calls this guy
is your fucking lawyer.

1973
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:45,612
I can't call him, right?

1974
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:47,447
- It's against the rules?
- I told you,

1975
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:49,204
whatever the fuck you say to him,

1976
01:28:49,282 --> 01:28:51,910
he's gonna use against you.
Don't you understand?

1977
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,745
He's smart, you're dumb.

1978
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,081
Fucking bullshit.

1979
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:58,167
Are we fucking talking tonight,
or are you gonna get schwacked?

1980
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,797
The last time you
took these fucking pills,

1981
01:28:59,918 --> 01:29:02,398
you put your head in the
fucking macaroni. I had to pick it up.

1982
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:04,431
All right.

1983
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:06,053
Okay, I won't call him.

1984
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:12,894
Hey, fellas! Come on board.
The plank's right around there.

1985
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:15,142
Welcome!

1986
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:17,945
What a nice day.

1987
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,279
Hey.

1988
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,277
Welcome aboard.

1989
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:25,402
Jordan. Welcome aboard the Naomi.
Pleasure to meet you.

1990
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:27,078
Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.

1991
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:28,200
Hi, how are you?

1992
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,534
Let me introduce you. This is Nicole,
Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy.

1993
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:34,119
What are you guys all shy for?
Don't be scared.

1994
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:35,402
These are friends of Stratton.

1995
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:36,955
- It's a pleasure.
- Hello.

1996
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:43,094
Your message said that
you wanted to speak privately.

1997
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:44,968
Right. I do want to speak privately.

1998
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,382
Give us a minute, huh, ladies?

1999
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:48,057
Let me know if I can get you anything.

2000
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:49,976
We'd be happy to help.

2001
01:29:50,176 --> 01:29:51,223
You guys hungry?

2002
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:54,102
Want something to eat?
Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster.

2003
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:56,558
I got whiskey.
Any kind of booze you want.

2004
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,109
You know what?
The Bureau doesn't allow us

2005
01:29:58,184 --> 01:29:59,606
to drink while we're at sea.

2006
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:02,238
Duh! Of course.

2007
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:04,157
Ever been on one of these before?

2008
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:05,568
A boat?

2009
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:07,615
I learned how to sail when I was six.

2010
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:09,788
No shit. Is that right? Really?

2011
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:11,581
On one like this, though?

2012
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:14,455
I had the whole front extended in order
to fit the chopper up there.

2013
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:15,873
See that?

2014
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,630
Anyway, this is for you.

2015
01:30:18,705 --> 01:30:21,549
It's a complete list of every person
that was at my wedding.

2016
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:24,378
I understand you wanted
the whole wedding video.

2017
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:27,214
Figured this would help expedite
the whole process, right?

2018
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:29,049
- There you go.
- Look,

2019
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:32,056
my point is that
I know you're investigating Stratton.

2020
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:35,639
But for the life of me,
I can't figure out why.

2021
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:37,391
I know we're a little unorthodox,

2022
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:39,194
we're a little loud in
the way we do things.

2023
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:40,393
But you gotta understand,

2024
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:41,945
we're the new guys
on the block, you know,

2025
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,148
we're trying to make
a name for ourselves.

2026
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:48,861
But I want you to understand,
we don't do anything illegal.

2027
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:50,745
Whatsoever.

2028
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,367
I mean, you could talk to the SEC.

2029
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:55,496
They were at my office 15 times
over the last six months.

2030
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:58,203
I mean, I got... I got nothing to hide.

2031
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:01,039
Well, you know the SEC
is a civil regulatory agency.

2032
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,669
We pursue criminal activities.

2033
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:05,593
Exactly! You go after real criminals,

2034
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:09,218
which makes me wonder what
the hell you're investigating me for?

2035
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:10,682
I mean, honestly...

2036
01:31:10,757 --> 01:31:14,603
What is it that you think
that we did or do? I don't get it.

2037
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:15,971
Well, I...

2038
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:18,477
Look, Jordan, I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation.

2039
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:20,229
No, I get that. No, I understand.

2040
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,727
With that said...

2041
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:24,445
This case got dumped on my desk...

2042
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:26,364
- Did it?
- You know, by a higher-up

2043
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:29,659
who needs to make a show of looking
into the new company on the block,

2044
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:31,202
- with all the press and everything.
- New loud guys.

2045
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:34,869
And then I end up being the schmuck
who does the looking. Exactly.

2046
01:31:34,948 --> 01:31:36,871
It's just, you know... It bothers me.

2047
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:39,499
We're the new guy. We're the one
that's banging on Wall Street's door.

2048
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:40,669
I mean, you should...

2049
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:42,745
You should see what's going on
at the bigger firms.

2050
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:44,215
I mean, I know all the information.

2051
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:47,173
It's true! Goldman,
Lehman Brothers, Merrill...

2052
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:49,254
Collateralized debt obligations?

2053
01:31:49,379 --> 01:31:50,631
This Internet stock bullshit?

2054
01:31:50,714 --> 01:31:52,512
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

2055
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:57,596
I could take you step-by-step
through what exactly is occurring.

2056
01:31:57,846 --> 01:31:59,439
All you have to do is ask.

2057
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:00,894
I'm available.

2058
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:02,434
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

2059
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:05,396
I don't see why a little sitdown like this

2060
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:07,832
can't be profitable for the both of us.

2061
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:10,192
It should. Right?
It should profit the both of us.

2062
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:11,777
- It should.
- Look.

2063
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:14,537
I'm gonna give you my personal line.

2064
01:32:14,612 --> 01:32:17,536
Five days a week,
you just call me, feel free.

2065
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:19,459
- I'll do that.
- Great.

2066
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:23,710
Are you sure you guys
don't want something to drink?

2067
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,461
You're not hungry? Nothing?

2068
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,167
- Nothing? No?
- Oh, no.

2069
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:32,889
Let me ask you,
and if you don't wanna get too personal,

2070
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:35,262
just tell me to shut up at any time.

2071
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:38,762
Did you try to get your
broker's license at one time?

2072
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:41,689
Did I hear that right? Were you trying
to take a stab at Wall Street?

2073
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:44,522
- No?
- Who you been talking to?

2074
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:45,602
Who the fuck you been talking to?

2075
01:32:45,685 --> 01:32:48,438
Well, you're investigating me.
I hear things.

2076
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:50,615
You know what I mean?

2077
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,283
You ever think about
what would've happened

2078
01:32:52,358 --> 01:32:54,827
if you would have stayed the course?

2079
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:58,080
You know what?
When I'm riding home on the subway

2080
01:32:58,156 --> 01:32:59,408
and my balls are fucking sweating,

2081
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:01,289
I'm wearing the same suit
three days in a row...

2082
01:33:01,367 --> 01:33:02,869
Yeah, you bet I do.

2083
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:04,625
I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't, right?

2084
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:05,825
Right, who fucking wouldn't?

2085
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,002
What do you get...

2086
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:08,334
Another personal question,
no need to answer...

2087
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:09,793
No, that's all right, Jordan.

2088
01:33:09,876 --> 01:33:12,925
What do you pull in? 50, 60K?
Something like that?

2089
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:15,048
A year? In the ballpark?

2090
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:16,599
Well, I...

2091
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:18,472
Let's put it this way.

2092
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:21,350
You get a free handgun
when you sign up for the Bureau.

2093
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:24,258
No, but it fucking pisses me off.
You know what I mean?

2094
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:26,480
You think about the people
that built this country,

2095
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:27,981
hardworking people like you.

2096
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:30,610
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.

2097
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:34,405
End of the day, you guys get
fucking skinned alive financially.

2098
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:36,361
It fucking makes me angry.

2099
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,539
Now the one thing about
Wall Street and this market is,

2100
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:41,287
for me, I feel

2101
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:44,711
it's good to give back.
You know, there's...

2102
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:46,959
There are situations where I can

2103
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:50,588
make those situations better for people.
You know?

2104
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:51,964
You know what I mean.

2105
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,465
Opportunity

2106
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:55,005
is everything.

2107
01:33:55,088 --> 01:33:56,340
Exactly.

2108
01:33:56,464 --> 01:33:58,933
Take for example,
I got this one kid, right?

2109
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:02,808
Went to school for environmental
science, something like that.

2110
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:04,685
He was bogged down by student loans.

2111
01:34:04,764 --> 01:34:07,483
Turns out, his mother
needed triple bypass surgery.

2112
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:08,999
- Jesus.
- Right. Horrible situation.

2113
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,027
Sure.

2114
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,195
But we got him into the market

2115
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:12,991
at the right time
and chose the right stock.

2116
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:14,816
We gave him the right guidance.

2117
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:18,073
Boom! Overnight,
changed his entire life.

2118
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:21,539
Got to put his mother into
the best hospital in New York City.

2119
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:24,493
It didn't work out for her, granted,
she passed away, unfortunately.

2120
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:26,499
But we gave him that opportunity.

2121
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:27,750
You know what I'm saying?

2122
01:34:28,454 --> 01:34:32,960
It's just about setting up the right team,
and then overnight your life can change.

2123
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:40,762
What does... What does an intern...

2124
01:34:42,302 --> 01:34:44,179
What does an intern
make in a deal like that?

2125
01:34:44,262 --> 01:34:46,310
Well, in that situation,

2126
01:34:47,223 --> 01:34:50,272
in that particular trade,
and it was one trade,

2127
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:53,105
north of half a million dollars.

2128
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:58,986
And I'd do that for anybody, you know,

2129
01:34:59,068 --> 01:35:01,742
anybody that needs
the proper guidance.

2130
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:25,645
Can you say that again,
just the way you said it?

2131
01:35:26,054 --> 01:35:27,772
Just the same way.

2132
01:35:31,976 --> 01:35:33,068
I don't know what you're talking about.

2133
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:35,397
Oh, come on! You know
what I'm talking about.

2134
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,482
I think what Jordan just did is he...

2135
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:38,725
- If I'm not mistaken...
- No.

2136
01:35:38,775 --> 01:35:40,903
you just tried to bribe a federal officer.

2137
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:43,079
No, technically I didn't bribe anybody.

2138
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:45,577
No, no, that's not
the conversation I heard, Jordan.

2139
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,159
No, no, according
to the U.S. criminal code,

2140
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:50,667
there needs to be an exact dollar figure
for the exchange of services.

2141
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:52,385
That would not hold up in a court of law.

2142
01:35:52,455 --> 01:35:54,128
Nah, it's not howl heard it.

2143
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:56,926
No, no, no, that's the truth.
But I want to tell you this.

2144
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:58,002
Yeah.

2145
01:35:58,086 --> 01:35:59,588
The same gentleman that told me

2146
01:35:59,671 --> 01:36:01,423
that you tried to get
your broker's license

2147
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:03,634
also told me that
you are a straight arrow.

2148
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:05,226
He ran a security check on me.

2149
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:06,518
Well...

2150
01:36:06,636 --> 01:36:09,606
Yeah, when you sail
on a boat fit for a Bond villain,

2151
01:36:09,681 --> 01:36:12,355
sometimes you need to
play the part. Right?

2152
01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:15,182
I think it's time you both
get the fuck off my boat.

2153
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:16,438
What do you say?

2154
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:18,774
You know, Jordan,
I'll tell you something.

2155
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:21,860
Most of the Wall Street
jackasses that I bust,

2156
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:24,621
they're to the manor born.

2157
01:36:24,696 --> 01:36:25,788
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

2158
01:36:25,863 --> 01:36:29,493
Their fathers are douchebags,
just like their fathers before them.

2159
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:32,040
But you...

2160
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:36,044
You, Jordan,
you got this way all on your own.

2161
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:37,379
Did I?

2162
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,552
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?

2163
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:40,921
Good for you.

2164
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:42,171
Me, the little man?

2165
01:36:42,255 --> 01:36:43,302
And let me tell you something.

2166
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:45,224
Let me tell you something else.

2167
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:47,514
Honestly, I'm not bullshitting here,

2168
01:36:47,677 --> 01:36:48,803
this is one of the nicest boats

2169
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:50,888
- that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you.
- I bet it is.

2170
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,394
And you know
what I was just thinking, too?

2171
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:55,769
The fucking hero that I'm gonna be
back at the office

2172
01:36:55,893 --> 01:36:58,066
when the Bureau seizes
this fucking boat.

2173
01:36:58,187 --> 01:37:00,360
Because, I mean,
fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,

2174
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,737
look at this thing!

2175
01:37:02,108 --> 01:37:03,155
It's beautiful!

2176
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:06,204
And you got the beautiful girls there.
It's wonderful.

2177
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:08,748
All right, get the fuck off my boat.

2178
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:10,453
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other

2179
01:37:10,533 --> 01:37:11,580
- real soon.
- I'm sure.

2180
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:15,129
Good luck on that subway ride home
to your miserable, ugly fucking wives.

2181
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:18,299
I'm gonna have Heidi lick some caviar
off my balls in the meantime.

2182
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:21,044
Hey, you guys want to take
some lobsters for your ride home?

2183
01:37:21,127 --> 01:37:23,755
Fucking miserable pricks,
I know you can't afford them!

2184
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:25,932
Fucking cheap fucks.

2185
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:28,058
Fucking miserable pricks.

2186
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:31,354
Hey, fellas! Look what
I found in my pocket! Look!

2187
01:37:31,637 --> 01:37:33,389
A year's salary right here.

2188
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:36,147
You know what I call them?
Fun coupons!

2189
01:37:36,225 --> 01:37:37,477
See that!

2190
01:37:38,019 --> 01:37:40,021
They're fun coupons!

2191
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:50,573
Switzerland?
What the fuck is in Switzerland?

2192
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,700
Swiss fucking banks, that's what.

2193
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:55,458
It was ass-covering time.
I had to hide my money.

2194
01:37:56,746 --> 01:37:58,293
Enter Rugrat.

2195
01:37:58,414 --> 01:38:00,054
He knew this Swiss banker
from law school.

2196
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:01,171
That's for European pussy!

2197
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:02,502
But he was in Geneva.

2198
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:04,963
And there was no way
I was gonna make that flight sober.

2199
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:08,425
So I knew if I took my drugs right,

2200
01:38:08,508 --> 01:38:10,556
I could sleep through the entire ﬂight.

2201
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:13,312
But I had to take them just right.

2202
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:15,978
At 4:00 p.m., I popped a few more ludes,

2203
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:17,525
which started kicking in by the time

2204
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,352
I finished my sales meeting.

2205
01:38:19,602 --> 01:38:20,819
My tingle phase.

2206
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:22,818
By dinner, I popped a few more

2207
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:25,821
on top of some cocktails
and a Valium or two.

2208
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:27,485
My slur phase.

2209
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:31,998
By 8:30, I took a few more ludes

2210
01:38:32,198 --> 01:38:34,792
and pretty much lost all my motor skills.

2211
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:36,536
This was the drool phase.

2212
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:42,959
And by 10:00, I didn't know
who or what the fuck I was.

2213
01:38:43,042 --> 01:38:44,635
The amnesia phase.

2214
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:47,513
We boarded the plane
just before midnight.

2215
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:49,306
Wow! Look at you!

2216
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:51,350
- You're beautiful.
- Excuse me, sir.

2217
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:53,724
His sleeping pills just kicked in.
He's all right.

2218
01:38:53,803 --> 01:38:55,350
May I see your boarding passes, sir?

2219
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:57,182
We have the boarding passes.

2220
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:59,308
Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her.

2221
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:01,652
Hey! Fucking relax.

2222
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:03,901
Oh, my God!
You got your hand on my fucking cock!

2223
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:05,357
I don't. Cut it out.

2224
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,441
He's got his hand on my dick again.

2225
01:39:06,524 --> 01:39:07,525
I'm just trying to buckle you up.

2226
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:08,825
You got your hand on his dick?

2227
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:10,869
You gotta stop doing that
in public places.

2228
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:12,913
Oh, my God. Take it off!

2229
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:14,198
Take it off!

2230
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:17,001
I heard there's
a treasure map under here.

2231
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:19,667
- Stop! I know, miss.
- Excuse me, sir.

2232
01:39:19,745 --> 01:39:21,247
Please sit down.

2233
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:22,798
- Watch it.
- Go back to your seat, please.

2234
01:39:22,874 --> 01:39:25,172
- What are you upset about?
- Please go back to your seat.

2235
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:27,128
I will have to call the captain.

2236
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:29,714
Please, sir, please, sir. Sit down.

2237
01:39:29,797 --> 01:39:31,470
Please sit down!

2238
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:33,142
- I'm going! Stop.
- Okay, sorry.

2239
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:34,844
We apologize. We're gonna go to sleep.

2240
01:39:34,927 --> 01:39:36,144
Question. I wanna ask you a question.

2241
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:37,767
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

2242
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:39,936
We cannot take off
if you haven't fastened

2243
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:41,063
- your seat belt.
- I'm really horny, too.

2244
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:42,268
Sit down. Fasten it.

2245
01:39:42,351 --> 01:39:43,853
- Right. Okay, I'll sit down...
- I will do it for you.

2246
01:39:43,936 --> 01:39:44,937
- What?
- I'll do it for you.

2247
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:46,193
You gotta speak English.

2248
01:39:46,272 --> 01:39:48,240
We don't understand
this language you're speaking.

2249
01:39:48,316 --> 01:39:49,818
I will help him with his seat belt.

2250
01:39:51,068 --> 01:39:53,229
- You gotta put it on right.
- Sit back. Sit back, sir.

2251
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:55,239
- There you go.
- All right. I'll just lean back...

2252
01:39:57,575 --> 01:39:59,248
Bitte, Hilfe!

2253
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:15,806
Jesus Christ!

2254
01:40:15,885 --> 01:40:17,262
Fuck!

2255
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:20,307
Donnie...

2256
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:23,526
Donnie, this isn't funny.
You gotta untie me, buddy.

2257
01:40:24,143 --> 01:40:25,861
I can't untie you.

2258
01:40:25,937 --> 01:40:28,781
The captain tied you up.
He almost fucking tasered you.

2259
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:30,779
Why?

2260
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:32,155
Why?

2261
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:35,113
He's got a fear of flying.

2262
01:40:39,492 --> 01:40:41,053
He's very nervous on planes, I'm sorry,

2263
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:43,038
it's not you, sweetheart,
don't beat yourself up.

2264
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:45,957
Easy, easy. He's fine.
He's just a nervous flyer.

2265
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:48,296
You were screaming at people.

2266
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:49,753
Oh, fuck off.

2267
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:51,963
You were on the floor
rolling around and shit.

2268
01:40:52,046 --> 01:40:53,093
Oh, Jesus.

2269
01:40:53,172 --> 01:40:55,266
You called the captain the N-word.

2270
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:56,843
I called the captain the N-word?

2271
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:59,187
- Yeah, he was very upset.
- Really?

2272
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:01,647
- Luckily we're in first class.
- Jesus.

2273
01:41:02,473 --> 01:41:05,317
Jesus Christ, I think
you have a fucking drug problem.

2274
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:07,899
Where are the ludes?

2275
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:09,026
Where are the ludes?

2276
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:11,566
They're up my ass. Don't worry about it.

2277
01:41:11,649 --> 01:41:13,242
- I got it.
- Okay.

2278
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:14,910
Thank God.

2279
01:41:15,361 --> 01:41:17,830
Jesus Christ, what are we gonna do
when we get to Switzerland, buddy?

2280
01:41:17,947 --> 01:41:18,948
This is bad.

2281
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:21,375
Fucking things are against
my chest. I can't breathe.

2282
01:41:21,492 --> 01:41:23,293
Come on, do something
to calm me down. Please.

2283
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:25,045
Okay, shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

2284
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:26,713
Okay.

2285
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:29,584
- That's good.
- Go to sleep.

2286
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:30,793
Rub it harder, buddy.

2287
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:32,511
You're all right.

2288
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:35,176
We all love you. Shut the fuck up!

2289
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:43,891
Mr. Belfort, you're free to go.

2290
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:47,189
Really?

2291
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:52,356
- Hey, Donnie.
- Yeah?

2292
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:53,942
When we get out there,
try not to act like yourself.

2293
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:56,323
Okay? Let's make Geneva
an asshole-free Donnie zone, all right?

2294
01:41:56,402 --> 01:41:57,824
What are you fucking coming at me for?

2295
01:41:57,903 --> 01:41:59,450
Hey, listen. The only reason
you're sitting in this limo

2296
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:01,123
and not in a Swiss jail
is because of my friend. Okay?

2297
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:02,370
Hilfe!

2298
01:42:03,326 --> 01:42:05,749
We're here. We're here.
Everyone calm down.

2299
01:42:06,245 --> 01:42:07,667
Jordan Belfort!

2300
01:42:07,747 --> 01:42:08,999
At last.

2301
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:11,675
Nicholas has told me
so much about you.

2302
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:13,628
Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.

2303
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:16,256
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you.

2304
01:42:16,839 --> 01:42:18,056
It's a joke.

2305
01:42:18,174 --> 01:42:20,427
You'll understand
when you're in the fucking seat.

2306
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:22,394
You need a bigger couch. For guests.

2307
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:24,188
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I don't understand. I'm sorry.

2308
01:42:24,263 --> 01:42:27,107
I'm curious about
your bank secrecy laws here.

2309
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:31,900
Wait. Yes. Excusez-moi, Jordan.

2310
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,529
Swiss custom requires 10 minutes of...

2311
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:36,651
Blah, blah, blah.

2312
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:38,374
- Chit chat.
- Yeah, chit chat, thank you.

2313
01:42:38,444 --> 01:42:40,071
before business can be discussed.

2314
01:42:41,614 --> 01:42:42,740
Yeah.

2315
01:42:45,534 --> 01:42:46,581
Of course.

2316
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:50,043
Let's get down to it.
What would you like to know?

2317
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:53,460
Under what circumstances
would you be obligated

2318
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:55,715
to cooperate with an FBI

2319
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:59,182
or a U.S. Justice Department
investigation, for example?

2320
01:42:59,799 --> 01:43:00,971
Ca depend.

2321
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:02,718
Ca depend?

2322
01:43:02,802 --> 01:43:03,803
Oui.

2323
01:43:04,887 --> 01:43:07,561
Ca depend on what, exactly?

2324
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:10,602
Whether America plans
to invade Switzerland

2325
01:43:10,685 --> 01:43:12,278
in the coming months.

2326
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:14,947
Shall I check if tanks
are rolling down the Rue de la Croy?

2327
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:17,116
- Yes. Rue de la Croix.
- Croix. Croix.

2328
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:20,035
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy. It's Croix.

2329
01:43:20,236 --> 01:43:22,455
See, this is what he used to do
back in law school. Check me.

2330
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:24,282
- Champagne. Champagne.
- Yeah.

2331
01:43:24,365 --> 01:43:26,743
Yeah, yeah.
French fries, pommes frites.

2332
01:43:27,493 --> 01:43:30,042
- And that kind of stuff.
- That's funny.

2333
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:36,507
What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,
is are you going to fuck me over?

2334
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:42,805
I understand perfectly,
you American shit.

2335
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:47,347
The only way
the Banque Réal de Genéve

2336
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:49,524
would cooperate
with a foreign legal body

2337
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:53,770
is if the crime being pursued
is also a crime in Switzerland.

2338
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:58,445
But there are very few Swiss laws
which apply to your practices.

2339
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:01,277
From a financial standpoint,

2340
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:04,455
you are now in heaven.

2341
01:44:04,613 --> 01:44:06,490
See, I told you he was fantastic, right?

2342
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:11,792
If the U.S. Justice Department
sent us a subpoena, it would become

2343
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:13,873
papier toilette.

2344
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:17,002
We would wipe our ass with it.

2345
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:20,262
Unless, of course,
it was an investigation

2346
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:22,180
into stock fraud,

2347
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:24,429
which is a crime here in Switzerland,
if I'm correct.

2348
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:28,513
Then there would
have to be coopération on your part,

2349
01:44:28,637 --> 01:44:30,605
- if I'm not mistaken.
- Yes.

2350
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:33,188
Yes, we would.

2351
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,899
Assuming the account
is under your name.

2352
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:40,153
If it were another name,

2353
01:44:41,358 --> 01:44:42,985
a friend's, camarade...

2354
01:44:43,068 --> 01:44:44,160
Cousin?

2355
01:44:48,908 --> 01:44:50,626
- Relative?
- Yeah.

2356
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:55,456
Was that yodeling I just heard

2357
01:44:55,581 --> 01:44:58,050
or did you just say
what I thought you said?

2358
01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,877
Yes. Yes.

2359
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:03,177
He's telling me to use a fucking rathole.

2360
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,053
But a U.S. rathole would never get

2361
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:07,351
into Switzerland with all that money.

2362
01:45:07,426 --> 01:45:11,272
What I needed was a rathole
with a European passport.

2363
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:19,984
Jordan.

2364
01:45:20,064 --> 01:45:22,943
Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh?

2365
01:45:23,025 --> 01:45:24,447
Welcome. Was the traffic terrible?

2366
01:45:24,527 --> 01:45:26,074
Oh, no, not at all.

2367
01:45:28,614 --> 01:45:30,241
Jordan, come in.

2368
01:45:30,407 --> 01:45:32,910
Thank God Aunt Emma
didn't need too much convincing.

2369
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:36,080
Turned out the British
weren't too different from the Swiss.

2370
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:38,750
Money talks and bullshit takes the bus.

2371
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:41,131
How do you say "rathole" in British?

2372
01:45:41,544 --> 01:45:44,013
If you get into any trouble whatsoever,

2373
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:46,841
I'll come forth immediately.
I'll say that I duped you.

2374
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:48,221
That I promise.

2375
01:45:48,926 --> 01:45:51,600
Risk is what keeps us young,
isn't it, darling?

2376
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:57,731
Sometimes I wonder

2377
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:01,022
if you let money get
the best of you, my love.

2378
01:46:01,146 --> 01:46:04,275
Among other substances.

2379
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:10,073
It's that obvious, huh?

2380
01:46:10,155 --> 01:46:13,409
It's chilly, darling,
and you're sweating bullets.

2381
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,963
What can I say? I'm...

2382
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:20,504
I'm a drug addict.

2383
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:21,967
I really am.

2384
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:24,754
Cocaine, pills.

2385
01:46:25,254 --> 01:46:27,677
Whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.

2386
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:29,933
Now that's the truth.

2387
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:31,261
I mean...

2388
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:32,720
I'm a sex addict, too.

2389
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:36,060
Well, there are worse things
to be addicted to than sex.

2390
01:46:37,349 --> 01:46:39,727
Jesus, why am I telling you all this?
Why am I...

2391
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,437
I'm sorry.

2392
01:46:42,187 --> 01:46:44,406
Because I'm very easy to talk to.

2393
01:46:44,773 --> 01:46:47,492
You are. You are easy to talk to.

2394
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:50,074
I suppose it's...

2395
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:51,576
Just my job, you know.

2396
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:54,791
All these people dependent on me.

2397
01:46:54,867 --> 01:46:57,586
Tens of millions of dollars
at stake, you know.

2398
01:46:57,661 --> 01:46:59,379
Sometimes I feel like I...

2399
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:02,629
I've bitten off more than
I can chew, you know.

2400
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:05,131
You're a man with large appetites.

2401
01:47:05,294 --> 01:47:06,386
Yeah.

2402
01:47:08,088 --> 01:47:10,011
Is she fucking hitting on me?

2403
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:11,388
Yeah.

2404
01:47:11,508 --> 01:47:12,805
Yeah, lam.

2405
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:18,524
I suppose I put that
on myself though, right?

2406
01:47:18,849 --> 01:47:20,396
My decision.

2407
01:47:20,893 --> 01:47:22,361
It's just hard to...

2408
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:26,361
Hard to learn to control
the anxiety sometimes, you know?

2409
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:28,488
You know, to...

2410
01:47:28,692 --> 01:47:31,366
Learn to relax and let go and...

2411
01:47:32,363 --> 01:47:34,365
To release the tension.

2412
01:47:35,407 --> 01:47:36,875
She is hitting on me.

2413
01:47:37,826 --> 01:47:39,248
Holy shit!

2414
01:47:39,536 --> 01:47:41,789
Yeah, to release the tension.

2415
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:47,378
I suppose we...

2416
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,264
We all just need to learn...

2417
01:47:50,881 --> 01:47:54,181
Learn to do what
comes naturally in life, you know?

2418
01:47:56,095 --> 01:47:58,564
Is he fucking hitting on me?

2419
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:06,443
Stability, dear.

2420
01:48:06,522 --> 01:48:07,944
Family.

2421
01:48:14,571 --> 01:48:16,744
You take care of my niece, my love.

2422
01:48:16,824 --> 01:48:19,373
I'll take care of everything over here.

2423
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:21,419
Deal.

2424
01:48:23,956 --> 01:48:26,129
Come on! There you go.

2425
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:31,422
We had, literally, a fuckload of money.

2426
01:48:31,922 --> 01:48:33,924
Aunt Emma could never
carry all this by herself.

2427
01:48:34,758 --> 01:48:38,433
So I thought to myself,
who else has a European passport?

2428
01:48:38,595 --> 01:48:40,518
Brad, you're making this
too fucking tight!

2429
01:48:40,597 --> 01:48:43,396
Now Brad, as a successful drug dealer,

2430
01:48:43,475 --> 01:48:45,694
spent his winters in the south of France,

2431
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:47,817
which is where
he met his wife, Chantalle,

2432
01:48:47,896 --> 01:48:50,775
a stripper of Slovenian origin

2433
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:52,363
born, in of all places,

2434
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:54,445
Switzerland.

2435
01:48:58,615 --> 01:49:00,288
Well, this is fucked.

2436
01:49:01,326 --> 01:49:02,794
No shit.

2437
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:08,759
Like, this will take her like 50 trips.

2438
01:49:08,834 --> 01:49:10,051
I know.

2439
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:14,973
Let me ask you something?

2440
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:17,684
What about her family? Right?

2441
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,434
I mean, they all got
Swiss passports, right.

2442
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:22,389
She's got parents,
she's got a brother, right?

2443
01:49:22,473 --> 01:49:24,396
The brother's got a wife.
That's five fucking people.

2444
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,398
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

2445
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:28,070
They're all fucking
Swiss nitwits like her.

2446
01:49:28,145 --> 01:49:29,397
- They'll do it.
- We could do that.

2447
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:31,949
At least I have a family,
you crooked-nose fuck!

2448
01:49:32,024 --> 01:49:34,868
Hey, don't forget about my money.

2449
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:37,745
I'm sorry, what's that?

2450
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:39,289
Yeah, I forgot to tell you.
He's got some...

2451
01:49:39,364 --> 01:49:41,412
- He's got some money.
- My money.

2452
01:49:41,784 --> 01:49:44,003
I got a couple of mil
coming in like a week.

2453
01:49:44,078 --> 01:49:46,672
When it gets in, I'll give you a call,
you come pick it up.

2454
01:49:49,291 --> 01:49:50,713
You give me a call?

2455
01:49:52,336 --> 01:49:55,590
When it gets here, I'll give you a call
and you'll come pick it up.

2456
01:49:55,672 --> 01:49:57,470
Well, we don't fucking
work for you, man!

2457
01:49:58,008 --> 01:50:00,978
Sweetheart,
you have my money taped to your tits.

2458
01:50:01,053 --> 01:50:03,055
Okay? Technically, you do work for me.

2459
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,693
Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk.

2460
01:50:07,935 --> 01:50:09,437
If I fucking do this,
I'm telling you right now,

2461
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,487
I ain't going to him, okay.

2462
01:50:10,562 --> 01:50:11,609
- I'm not a fucking shvartze.
- I got it.

2463
01:50:11,688 --> 01:50:12,985
I don't do fucking pickups, all right?

2464
01:50:13,065 --> 01:50:14,112
- I got it.
- Well, listen to me.

2465
01:50:14,191 --> 01:50:15,784
We meet someplace that I fucking say.

2466
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:17,236
And you tell that fucking piece of shit,

2467
01:50:17,319 --> 01:50:18,491
- he comes correct.
- I will.

2468
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:20,890
He comes in all fucking loopy
and fucked up, I swear to God

2469
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:22,791
I'll mash that douchebags teeth in.

2470
01:50:22,866 --> 01:50:24,618
You're gonna mash
whose fucking teeth in?

2471
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:26,419
Whose fucking teeth
are you gonna mash in?

2472
01:50:26,495 --> 01:50:28,793
I put the money on that
fucking table! Not you!

2473
01:50:28,872 --> 01:50:30,715
I'm the reason
we have this whole fucking deal!

2474
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:32,831
- He's got a gun, you fucking idiot!
- Fuck his gun!

2475
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:34,253
I put that money in there!

2476
01:50:34,336 --> 01:50:35,713
You know what?
You're a fucking pill dealer.

2477
01:50:35,796 --> 01:50:38,094
I got five more just like you, bro.

2478
01:50:38,173 --> 01:50:39,891
Keep talking, you fucking piece of shit!

2479
01:50:39,967 --> 01:50:41,719
You know what else?
You dress like shit!

2480
01:50:41,802 --> 01:50:42,803
So fuck you!

2481
01:50:42,886 --> 01:50:44,638
- Fucking motherfucker!
- Oh! Jesus!

2482
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:46,564
How about that, faggot?
Who's a faggot?

2483
01:50:46,682 --> 01:50:48,480
You okay? Hey, pal.

2484
01:50:51,186 --> 01:50:53,985
The next day,
Aunt Emma ﬂew to Geneva.

2485
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:56,408
Two million in cash in her carry-on,

2486
01:50:56,483 --> 01:50:59,453
which in the big picture
was a drop in the Swiss bucket.

2487
01:51:00,696 --> 01:51:01,993
'Cause the following month,

2488
01:51:02,072 --> 01:51:03,949
over the course of six round trips,

2489
01:51:04,032 --> 01:51:08,082
Chantalle's family and friends
smuggled in over 20 million in cash

2490
01:51:08,162 --> 01:51:09,914
without even a hiccup.

2491
01:51:14,918 --> 01:51:16,841
- And I have some more.
- Really?

2492
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,137
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

2493
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:19,339
And here.

2494
01:51:19,423 --> 01:51:21,425
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

2495
01:51:21,508 --> 01:51:23,761
Yeah, like four bags of it.

2496
01:51:25,387 --> 01:51:27,731
Are you Swiss-Slovakian
or Swiss-Slovenian?

2497
01:51:27,806 --> 01:51:29,353
- Slovenian.
- Slovenian?

2498
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:30,650
Who cares. You're blonde.

2499
01:51:30,726 --> 01:51:31,727
Oh, stop.

2500
01:51:52,581 --> 01:51:53,707
Shit.

2501
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:55,111
Just put the fucking car in park,

2502
01:51:55,125 --> 01:51:56,923
you dumb fucking idiot!

2503
01:51:58,462 --> 01:52:00,089
I can't close this briefcase.

2504
01:52:00,172 --> 01:52:01,549
One fucking day.

2505
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:03,600
One fucking day,
you couldn't keep it together?

2506
01:52:03,675 --> 01:52:05,268
I'm fucked up, Brad.

2507
01:52:05,802 --> 01:52:08,430
- Gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Fucked up.

2508
01:52:13,268 --> 01:52:14,770
- It's a joke.
- It's a joke?

2509
01:52:14,853 --> 01:52:16,821
- I'm sober.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

2510
01:52:16,897 --> 01:52:17,898
It's a fucking joke.

2511
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:19,574
- Are you fucking stupid?
- I'm not stupid.

2512
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,118
You fucking drive in here
like a fucking maniac,

2513
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:23,036
you know the attention that
that fucking draws?

2514
01:52:23,111 --> 01:52:25,785
- I'm not stupid. I'm smart.
- Smart?

2515
01:52:25,864 --> 01:52:27,958
- I make million-dollar deals.
- That right?

2516
01:52:28,033 --> 01:52:30,411
With smart important people,
unlike you.

2517
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:34,374
People who don't sucker-punch people
when they're scared. Okay?

2518
01:52:34,456 --> 01:52:35,856
- I'm scared, huh?
- And by the way,

2519
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:36,917
I haven't gotten an apology yet for that.

2520
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,047
You want an apology, okay.

2521
01:52:38,126 --> 01:52:39,606
I check my fucking messages every day

2522
01:52:39,628 --> 01:52:40,595
- when I come home from work.
- Did you?

2523
01:52:40,671 --> 01:52:41,923
- My answering machine. Zero.
- Didn't get one, huh?

2524
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,052
I got a blinking light,

2525
01:52:43,131 --> 01:52:44,428
because I don't have shit from you.

2526
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:45,725
You know what, you got
a big fucking mouth, okay?

2527
01:52:45,801 --> 01:52:47,053
I got my wife checking the messages

2528
01:52:47,135 --> 01:52:49,137
every 45 minutes
calling the office, saying,

2529
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:50,438
"Has Brad apologized yet?

2530
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:52,516
"Is there an apology message
on the machine?"

2531
01:52:52,599 --> 01:52:54,146
I don't have jack shit. You know what?

2532
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:55,648
That's not how you treat people.

2533
01:52:55,727 --> 01:52:56,774
You got a big fucking mouth, you know.

2534
01:52:56,853 --> 01:52:58,526
I'm gonna give you a fucking pass.
Just give me the case.

2535
01:52:58,605 --> 01:53:00,824
You're gonna give me a pass?

2536
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:02,492
Look, it's a figure of fucking speech.

2537
01:53:02,567 --> 01:53:04,535
Oh, my gosh. The Emperor of Fucksville

2538
01:53:04,611 --> 01:53:05,908
came down from Fucksville
to give me a pass!

2539
01:53:05,988 --> 01:53:06,989
From Fucksville, huh?

2540
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:08,949
Hey, what are the citizens
of Fucksville doing today

2541
01:53:09,032 --> 01:53:10,500
when their Emperor's gone?

2542
01:53:10,575 --> 01:53:12,122
Is it mayhem?

2543
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:14,000
Are people looting and raping?

2544
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:16,081
What are all the little fuckheads
doing while you're here?

2545
01:53:16,164 --> 01:53:17,586
Go fuck yourself! Give me the bag.

2546
01:53:17,666 --> 01:53:18,963
You back the fuck up.

2547
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:22,512
I'll cause the biggest fucking scene
that I've ever caused in my life

2548
01:53:22,587 --> 01:53:24,339
if you come at me again.

2549
01:53:24,423 --> 01:53:26,016
- You know what?
- Just fucking keep it down.

2550
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:27,308
I got...

2551
01:53:27,384 --> 01:53:31,981
I don't wanna be out of line or anything,
but I think you like, like me. Like you...

2552
01:53:32,055 --> 01:53:33,523
Like when you come at me...

2553
01:53:33,598 --> 01:53:34,690
What's the matter with you?
What the fuck is...

2554
01:53:34,766 --> 01:53:36,188
and you look at me.
I swear I just noticed it.

2555
01:53:36,268 --> 01:53:37,986
You have like a fucking, like...

2556
01:53:38,061 --> 01:53:40,063
Like a twinkle. You have like a twinkle.

2557
01:53:40,147 --> 01:53:41,615
Are you trying to kiss me, bro?

2558
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:43,283
Jesus fucking Christ.

2559
01:53:43,358 --> 01:53:45,326
- What's with you?
- I have a... I don't know.

2560
01:53:45,402 --> 01:53:47,162
- It's not a homophobic thing.
- All right...

2561
01:53:47,195 --> 01:53:48,913
You're just not the one for me, pal.

2562
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:50,115
You know what I mean? It's not...

2563
01:53:50,198 --> 01:53:52,121
- it's not about that for me, you know.
- I've heard enough.

2564
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:54,623
Please, I'm begging,
give me the fucking case.

2565
01:53:54,703 --> 01:53:56,080
- I'm gonna give you the case.
- Give me the case.

2566
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:57,540
- You gotta do me one favor.
- What's that?

2567
01:53:57,622 --> 01:54:00,922
You gotta take this case,
you gotta drive straight home,

2568
01:54:01,001 --> 01:54:04,505
need you to open up the briefcase,
and you take out every single dollar.

2569
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:06,556
Don't leave one dollar
inside the briefcase.

2570
01:54:06,631 --> 01:54:07,757
And once you have it all

2571
01:54:07,841 --> 01:54:09,639
neatly organized outside the briefcase,

2572
01:54:09,718 --> 01:54:12,016
I need you to take it
and I need you to shove it right up

2573
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:14,189
your wife's Latvian cunt,
you understand?

2574
01:54:14,264 --> 01:54:15,937
- My fucking wife!
- Chill! Chill, bro.

2575
01:54:16,016 --> 01:54:17,536
Fuck. You motherfucking piece of shit!

2576
01:54:17,559 --> 01:54:18,606
How about now?

2577
01:54:18,769 --> 01:54:20,146
- Go, go!
- Fuck!

2578
01:54:21,897 --> 01:54:23,615
Motherfuck! You're fucking dead!

2579
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:25,363
Stop! Don't move! Don't move!

2580
01:54:25,442 --> 01:54:28,286
Stop, or I will blow you the fuck away!

2581
01:54:28,695 --> 01:54:30,868
Drop the case!
Put your hands in the air!

2582
01:54:30,947 --> 01:54:32,073
Get down.

2583
01:54:32,866 --> 01:54:34,707
Get down on your knees!
Get down on your knees!

2584
01:54:35,327 --> 01:54:36,749
Motherfucker!

2585
01:54:38,789 --> 01:54:39,836
Motherfucker!

2586
01:54:49,007 --> 01:54:52,227
Jordan, do I have a surprise for you!

2587
01:54:52,469 --> 01:54:55,063
- What's that?
- Twenty real Lemmons.

2588
01:54:55,138 --> 01:54:56,310
Retired pharmacist's client of mine,

2589
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,562
they've been in the safe for 15 years.

2590
01:54:57,641 --> 01:54:59,109
Are you fucking kidding me? Lemmons?

2591
01:55:00,352 --> 01:55:02,229
They're gonna knock us
on our fucking heads.

2592
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:07,239
When it comes to Quaaludes,
the Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail.

2593
01:55:07,317 --> 01:55:08,819
- Can you believe it?
- Oh, my God.

2594
01:55:08,902 --> 01:55:10,370
I thought they were like a myth.

2595
01:55:10,445 --> 01:55:12,322
Three times as powerful
as anything available today.

2596
01:55:12,406 --> 01:55:13,453
Look at these babies.

2597
01:55:13,532 --> 01:55:16,126
Boy, Donnie really knew
how to celebrate.

2598
01:55:16,201 --> 01:55:18,295
He said he was saving these
for a special occasion.

2599
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:20,964
Like a birthday, or being clap free,

2600
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:24,009
or our money arriving
safely in Switzerland.

2601
01:55:27,421 --> 01:55:28,673
So that night,

2602
01:55:28,755 --> 01:55:30,598
I cleared my schedule and I rid my body

2603
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:33,177
of anything that could fuck with my high.

2604
01:55:33,885 --> 01:55:35,683
It was celebration time.

2605
01:55:36,263 --> 01:55:37,435
Okay.

2606
01:55:37,514 --> 01:55:39,016
Start off with one, see how it goes?

2607
01:55:39,099 --> 01:55:40,851
My guy says all we'll need is one.

2608
01:55:40,934 --> 01:55:42,356
Here you go.

2609
01:55:43,061 --> 01:55:44,734
- Salud!
- Cheers.

2610
01:55:44,813 --> 01:55:47,612
Maybe if I pull it again, it'll go down.

2611
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:50,611
Steve! Steve!

2612
01:55:50,694 --> 01:55:51,946
I gotta get out of here!

2613
01:55:52,028 --> 01:55:53,905
Carl, I think I got it figured out.

2614
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:57,710
It must be one pull for up
and two pulls for down.

2615
01:55:57,784 --> 01:55:59,036
Okay-

2616
01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:09,175
Do you feel anything?

2617
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:13,012
No.

2618
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:17,562
It's been 35 minutes.

2619
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:23,606
Maybe we've built up a tolerance
after all these years, huh?

2620
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,162
This is bullshit!

2621
01:56:38,241 --> 01:56:41,415
My metabolism's pumping.
I can't feel shit!

2622
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:42,667
They're old.

2623
01:56:42,746 --> 01:56:44,919
You think they lost their potency, huh?

2624
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:46,625
Check the bottle!

2625
01:56:49,461 --> 01:56:50,883
January '81.

2626
01:56:50,962 --> 01:56:52,054
They're fucking duds.

2627
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:53,177
Fuck!

2628
01:56:53,256 --> 01:56:54,348
Let's take...

2629
01:56:54,424 --> 01:56:55,926
Let's take two more each.

2630
01:56:57,886 --> 01:57:00,435
- Jordan.
- Yeah, baby.

2631
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:05,818
What are you two retards doing?

2632
01:57:05,894 --> 01:57:06,986
We're working out, honey.

2633
01:57:07,437 --> 01:57:09,030
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2634
01:57:09,105 --> 01:57:10,106
Okay.

2635
01:57:10,190 --> 01:57:12,113
- Okay?
"Okay

2636
01:57:13,610 --> 01:57:15,157
Hey, Bo, what's going on?

2637
01:57:15,237 --> 01:57:16,397
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2638
01:57:16,446 --> 01:57:19,040
I cannot talk to you on this phone,
I have to talk to you.

2639
01:57:19,115 --> 01:57:20,617
Get out of here. What's going on?

2640
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:24,045
Listen to me!
Leave the fucking house, Jordan,

2641
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,793
and then call me from a pay phone.

2642
01:57:25,872 --> 01:57:27,840
This is not a fucking joke, Jordan.

2643
01:57:27,916 --> 01:57:29,543
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2644
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:31,386
- Shit.
- What'd he say?

2645
01:57:31,461 --> 01:57:32,838
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

2646
01:57:32,921 --> 01:57:34,889
- I gotta go!
- Is everything okay, Jordan?

2647
01:57:45,308 --> 01:57:47,060
The closest pay phone I could get to

2648
01:57:47,143 --> 01:57:49,441
was at the Brookville Country Club.

2649
01:57:50,105 --> 01:57:52,073
It was a real WASP stronghold,

2650
01:57:52,148 --> 01:57:54,742
just a mile down the road
from my house.

2651
01:58:04,202 --> 01:58:05,624
Hey, Bo, what's up, it's me.
What's going on?

2652
01:58:05,704 --> 01:58:06,751
I'm at a pay phone. What's going on?

2653
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:07,956
Listen to me carefully.

2654
01:58:08,039 --> 01:58:11,794
Please. Your little friend there, Brad,
your little buddy, he's in jail.

2655
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:13,757
What the fuck's he in jail for?

2656
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:15,305
- What'd he do?
- / don't know what he did.

2657
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:16,723
My friends in Long Island told me

2658
01:58:16,798 --> 01:58:19,017
he got picked up
in some fucking shopping mall.

2659
01:58:19,092 --> 01:58:20,093
He got locked up by...

2660
01:58:20,176 --> 01:58:22,429
Wait, wait. Did you...
Did you say a shopping mall?

2661
01:58:22,512 --> 01:58:23,809
- Yeah.
- He was with Donnie.

2662
01:58:23,888 --> 01:58:25,265
He was supposed
to deliver some money,

2663
01:58:25,348 --> 01:58:26,895
- then that fucking fat piece of shit...
- Listen to me!

2664
01:58:26,975 --> 01:58:27,976
I gotta go fucking talk to him right now!

2665
01:58:28,059 --> 01:58:29,982
Listen to me! Don't go! Listen to me.

2666
01:58:30,061 --> 01:58:32,689
That guy Denham, that FBI agent guy,

2667
01:58:32,772 --> 01:58:35,070
somebody told me
he's got your phones tapped.

2668
01:58:35,150 --> 01:58:36,652
Your office and your home.

2669
01:58:36,735 --> 01:58:38,453
Don't talk on the motherfucking phone!

2670
01:58:38,528 --> 01:58:40,451
Okay. Fuck! I got it. I got it. I got it.

2671
01:58:40,905 --> 01:58:42,031
Jordan.

2672
01:58:42,574 --> 01:58:46,374
You didn't try to bribe
this fucking FBI agent, did you?

2673
01:58:46,453 --> 01:58:48,501
No, I didn't try to bribe an FBI agent.

2674
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:50,127
You think I'm that fucking stupid? No.

2675
01:58:50,206 --> 01:58:52,166
What the fuck did you say?
I can't understand you.

2676
01:58:52,167 --> 01:58:53,339
Say that again.

2677
01:58:53,418 --> 01:58:56,217
I said...

2678
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,803
What the fuck are you saying?

2679
01:58:59,382 --> 01:59:00,383
I said...

2680
01:59:00,467 --> 01:59:01,935
Are you fucking high?

2681
01:59:04,554 --> 01:59:07,182
Jordan, are you fucking high?

2682
01:59:08,016 --> 01:59:10,144
Jordan, do me a favor,
stay where you are.

2683
01:59:10,226 --> 01:59:11,853
Don't get behind the wheel of the car.

2684
01:59:11,936 --> 01:59:13,537
I'm gonna send Rocco over
to pick you up.

2685
01:59:13,563 --> 01:59:14,815
Jordan! Jordan!

2686
01:59:14,898 --> 01:59:17,151
After 15 years in storage,

2687
01:59:17,233 --> 01:59:20,203
the Lemmons had
developed a delayed fuse.

2688
01:59:20,278 --> 01:59:22,952
It took 90 minutes for
these little fuckers to kick in.

2689
01:59:23,031 --> 01:59:24,408
But once they did...

2690
01:59:25,950 --> 01:59:27,497
I mean, I had skipped the tingle phase

2691
01:59:27,577 --> 01:59:29,500
and went straight to the drool phase.

2692
01:59:29,579 --> 01:59:31,547
Tell me where you are!
Don't fucking drive...

2693
01:59:31,623 --> 01:59:33,546
These little bastards were so strong,

2694
01:59:33,625 --> 01:59:35,673
I discovered a whole new phase.

2695
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:37,800
The cerebral palsy phase.

2696
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:42,092
Come on, stand up!

2697
01:59:46,054 --> 01:59:47,977
Okay, walking's out.

2698
01:59:48,932 --> 01:59:51,811
All right, think, think.
What else is there?

2699
01:59:52,644 --> 01:59:56,365
Yes! I can crawl. I can crawl like Skylar!

2700
02:00:28,012 --> 02:00:30,982
Fuck! The kid makes it look
so goddamn easy!

2701
02:00:38,022 --> 02:00:40,400
Think, you motherfucker, think!

2702
02:00:40,483 --> 02:00:41,826
Yes!

2703
02:00:41,901 --> 02:00:43,995
I got it! I've got it!

2704
02:00:44,404 --> 02:00:46,577
I can roll! I can roll!

2705
02:02:08,905 --> 02:02:10,157
Jordan.

2706
02:02:11,741 --> 02:02:13,084
Jordan.

2707
02:02:13,451 --> 02:02:15,124
Oh, Jesus. Where are you?

2708
02:02:15,203 --> 02:02:16,671
I'm at a country club!

2709
02:02:16,746 --> 02:02:17,793
What?

2710
02:02:17,872 --> 02:02:20,716
I'm at a country club!

2711
02:02:20,792 --> 02:02:22,135
I don't know what
the fuck you're saying.

2712
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:23,462
Look, you need to get home.

2713
02:02:23,545 --> 02:02:26,173
Donnie is out of control!
He's on the other line

2714
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:28,133
with some Swiss guy. I don't know...

2715
02:02:28,216 --> 02:02:29,217
What?

2716
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:32,270
Get him off the phone!

2717
02:02:32,595 --> 02:02:35,348
I can't understand you!

2718
02:02:35,431 --> 02:02:36,683
Get him

2719
02:02:36,766 --> 02:02:37,813
off

2720
02:02:37,892 --> 02:02:39,018
the phone!

2721
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:40,354
I don't know what the fuck
you're saying, Jordan.

2722
02:02:40,436 --> 02:02:41,779
Can you just get home? Hurry!

2723
02:02:51,614 --> 02:02:53,742
I was less than a mile from home.

2724
02:02:53,825 --> 02:02:56,544
I drove as slow as I fucking could.

2725
02:02:56,619 --> 02:02:58,621
I'd seen Jell-O move faster.

2726
02:02:58,705 --> 02:03:01,128
I was gonna give you two million.

2727
02:03:01,291 --> 02:03:03,840
I's gonna be lates.

2728
02:03:04,502 --> 02:03:06,095
You ate two million?

2729
02:03:07,005 --> 02:03:08,257
Later.

2730
02:03:08,339 --> 02:03:09,465
Get off the phone.

2731
02:03:09,549 --> 02:03:11,051
Get off the fucking phone! Idiot!

2732
02:03:12,427 --> 02:03:14,521
Get out of the way, asshole!

2733
02:03:17,181 --> 02:03:18,433
You hate two million?

2734
02:03:18,516 --> 02:03:20,077
No, you don't hate two million, Donnie.

2735
02:03:22,562 --> 02:03:25,441
By some miracle, I made it home alive,

2736
02:03:25,523 --> 02:03:27,821
not a scratch on me or the car.

2737
02:03:37,243 --> 02:03:38,335
Jordan?

2738
02:03:38,828 --> 02:03:41,422
Jesus fucking Christ!

2739
02:03:41,497 --> 02:03:42,999
What did you take?

2740
02:03:43,082 --> 02:03:44,379
What's wrong with you?

2741
02:03:44,459 --> 02:03:45,460
Jor!

2742
02:03:45,543 --> 02:03:47,921
It's fucking good, right?

2743
02:03:48,004 --> 02:03:49,347
Fucked up!

2744
02:03:50,673 --> 02:03:52,516
Get off the phone!

2745
02:03:55,553 --> 02:03:57,772
What the fuck, Jordan?

2746
02:03:57,847 --> 02:03:59,440
Your daughter's in the house!

2747
02:03:59,515 --> 02:04:00,607
I hope you know that!

2748
02:04:00,683 --> 02:04:02,163
Your fucking daughter's in the house!

2749
02:04:02,518 --> 02:04:04,038
Yeah, it's real fucking funny, Donnie.

2750
02:04:04,062 --> 02:04:06,485
Get off the phone!

2751
02:04:07,649 --> 02:04:08,616
Jesus Christ, Jordan.

2752
02:04:08,691 --> 02:04:10,364
The FBI!

2753
02:04:11,694 --> 02:04:12,946
Hey!

2754
02:04:13,488 --> 02:04:15,365
I'm on phone!

2755
02:04:15,573 --> 02:04:17,951
Get off the fucking phone!

2756
02:04:19,702 --> 02:04:21,704
- Come here!
- ...the phone.

2757
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:26,919
Come on. We're gonna
go upstairs, all right.

2758
02:04:31,798 --> 02:04:33,300
I'm on the phone!

2759
02:04:33,383 --> 02:04:34,726
On the phone!

2760
02:04:34,801 --> 02:04:36,895
I know what you did,

2761
02:04:37,387 --> 02:04:38,809
you piece of shit!

2762
02:04:38,888 --> 02:04:40,606
What? What?

2763
02:04:40,682 --> 02:04:42,025
Brad!

2764
02:04:43,726 --> 02:04:45,194
Brad!

2765
02:04:45,687 --> 02:04:46,904
Brad!

2766
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:49,403
You fucking cocksucker!

2767
02:04:53,736 --> 02:04:55,613
What did you do,

2768
02:04:55,697 --> 02:04:57,495
you piece of shit?

2769
02:04:57,573 --> 02:04:58,995
Fuck you!

2770
02:05:00,243 --> 02:05:02,541
I wanna fucking kill you!

2771
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:04,793
I wanna fucking kill you!

2772
02:05:05,748 --> 02:05:07,091
I got you!

2773
02:05:31,649 --> 02:05:33,572
What the fuck happened?

2774
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:35,279
Oh, shit!

2775
02:05:35,361 --> 02:05:37,238
Jordan? Jordan, are you all right?

2776
02:05:37,405 --> 02:05:38,998
Donnie? Donnie?

2777
02:05:39,323 --> 02:05:40,415
Donnie?

2778
02:05:40,491 --> 02:05:41,834
Jordan, he's not breathing.

2779
02:05:41,909 --> 02:05:43,707
Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do.

2780
02:05:43,786 --> 02:05:45,038
Jordan, I don't know what the fuck to do!

2781
02:05:45,121 --> 02:05:46,601
I can't help him! Oh, my God. Jordan.

2782
02:05:48,499 --> 02:05:51,048
Oh, my God, I think he's choking,
Jordan. Do something.

2783
02:05:51,127 --> 02:05:52,879
- Oh, God.
- Baby, I got you!

2784
02:05:53,463 --> 02:05:56,342
He's not breathing, Jordan.
You gotta do something!

2785
02:05:57,258 --> 02:05:59,556
Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2786
02:06:01,471 --> 02:06:02,814
I got you!

2787
02:06:22,158 --> 02:06:23,751
Step aside!

2788
02:06:23,993 --> 02:06:25,370
Oh, God!

2789
02:06:25,828 --> 02:06:27,296
Oh, God!

2790
02:06:27,663 --> 02:06:29,415
Move aside, baby.

2791
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:38,178
Come on! Come on!

2792
02:06:38,257 --> 02:06:39,474
Come on!

2793
02:06:44,013 --> 02:06:46,687
Jordan, he's not breathing.
You gotta do something.

2794
02:06:47,725 --> 02:06:49,773
Jordan, he's a father!
He's got fucking kids!

2795
02:06:49,852 --> 02:06:51,525
- Do something!
- Yeah?

2796
02:06:57,193 --> 02:06:58,285
Rocco, you gotta get over here.

2797
02:06:58,361 --> 02:07:00,284
- Come on.
- Call an ambulance!

2798
02:07:00,363 --> 02:07:01,535
I don't fucking know!

2799
02:07:01,614 --> 02:07:03,366
Just get over here! Call 911.

2800
02:07:11,415 --> 02:07:12,416
Yeah.

2801
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:16,304
You all right? He's all right.

2802
02:07:29,475 --> 02:07:31,569
Mr. Belfort?

2803
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:33,988
Mr. Belfort?

2804
02:07:36,649 --> 02:07:39,573
Get the fuck out of here. Fuck.

2805
02:07:39,652 --> 02:07:42,155
Sir, we need to ask you some questions.

2806
02:07:42,822 --> 02:07:44,790
Are you fucking kidding me? Fuck you.

2807
02:07:44,866 --> 02:07:45,992
Come on, get up.

2808
02:07:46,075 --> 02:07:47,622
Get the fuck out of my house.

2809
02:07:49,412 --> 02:07:51,130
- Let's go.
- I've been here all night.

2810
02:07:51,205 --> 02:07:52,707
I been sitting here all night.

2811
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:54,230
What the fuck are you talking about?

2812
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:56,218
- Where you taking him?
- Where you taking me?

2813
02:07:56,294 --> 02:07:57,386
Where you taking him?

2814
02:07:57,461 --> 02:07:58,508
You ain't got no warrant.

2815
02:07:58,588 --> 02:08:00,189
Just come up
in people's house like that!

2816
02:08:01,048 --> 02:08:03,346
Did you drive your car tonight,
Mr. Belfort?

2817
02:08:04,927 --> 02:08:05,974
Well?

2818
02:08:09,265 --> 02:08:10,642
Wow!

2819
02:08:10,933 --> 02:08:12,731
Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.

2820
02:08:27,867 --> 02:08:30,245
Get out of the fucking way!

2821
02:08:32,205 --> 02:08:33,457
Fuck!

2822
02:08:39,086 --> 02:08:42,716
Did you drive that car tonight?

2823
02:08:43,841 --> 02:08:45,969
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

2824
02:08:46,052 --> 02:08:47,850
I'm a family man!

2825
02:08:47,929 --> 02:08:49,681
Family man. Honey!

2826
02:08:49,764 --> 02:08:51,732
It was a miracle I wasn't killed,

2827
02:08:51,807 --> 02:08:54,811
or that I didn't kill anybody else.

2828
02:08:54,894 --> 02:08:58,068
The cops took me in for questioning,
but they couldn't charge me.

2829
02:08:58,147 --> 02:09:00,570
They had no proof
I was even behind the wheel.

2830
02:09:00,650 --> 02:09:01,742
Meanwhile,

2831
02:09:01,817 --> 02:09:03,911
Brad did three months
in jail for contempt

2832
02:09:03,986 --> 02:09:06,580
because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.

2833
02:09:06,656 --> 02:09:09,375
The result, I was soot-free.

2834
02:09:09,450 --> 02:09:11,828
But I had eyes on me like never before.

2835
02:09:11,911 --> 02:09:13,584
You're a lucky man, Jordan.

2836
02:09:13,663 --> 02:09:16,587
You're lucky to be alive,
let alone not in jail.

2837
02:09:16,666 --> 02:09:18,267
You know I don't believe in luck, right?

2838
02:09:18,334 --> 02:09:19,677
But it's time.

2839
02:09:19,752 --> 02:09:22,005
Please, let me call the SEC
and cut a deal

2840
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:24,011
before your luck runs out.

2841
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:25,683
Wave to Daddy.

2842
02:09:25,758 --> 02:09:26,850
Hey.

2843
02:09:26,926 --> 02:09:28,428
Hey, sweetie.

2844
02:09:33,641 --> 02:09:36,941
What kind of terms
would you be talking about if I...

2845
02:09:37,019 --> 02:09:38,236
I don't know.

2846
02:09:38,312 --> 02:09:41,282
You plead guilty to a handful
of securities violations,

2847
02:09:41,357 --> 02:09:44,406
stock manipulation,
high-pressure sales tactics.

2848
02:09:44,485 --> 02:09:47,284
Ticky-tack shit like that, you know.

2849
02:09:47,363 --> 02:09:49,331
You pay a couple
million dollars in fines,

2850
02:09:49,407 --> 02:09:52,377
in exchange, the SEC
fucks off till the end of time.

2851
02:09:54,704 --> 02:09:56,331
And Stratton?

2852
02:09:56,831 --> 02:09:58,708
What happens to Stratton?

2853
02:09:58,791 --> 02:10:01,635
There's no way... I mean...
You got to walk away. Right?

2854
02:10:01,711 --> 02:10:02,837
Let Donnie be in charge.

2855
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,547
Right. Donnie.

2856
02:10:05,256 --> 02:10:07,429
Now the FBI is
another animal completely.

2857
02:10:07,508 --> 02:10:09,306
They'll still be pursuing you
for criminal wrongdoing.

2858
02:10:09,385 --> 02:10:12,138
However, with you
stepping down voluntarily,

2859
02:10:12,221 --> 02:10:14,144
my guess is that
your best friend Agent Denham

2860
02:10:14,223 --> 02:10:16,567
will be standing around
with his dick in his hand.

2861
02:10:17,685 --> 02:10:18,982
Jordan.

2862
02:10:19,061 --> 02:10:20,984
What do you have to think about?

2863
02:10:21,063 --> 02:10:22,656
You beat them.

2864
02:10:22,732 --> 02:10:23,858
You won!

2865
02:10:23,941 --> 02:10:25,568
God knows you never
have to work again.

2866
02:10:25,651 --> 02:10:27,653
What're you gonna do?
Spend the rest of your life in jail?

2867
02:10:27,737 --> 02:10:28,897
- Is that what you want?
- No.

2868
02:10:28,904 --> 02:10:29,951
- Of course not.
- Okay.

2869
02:10:30,031 --> 02:10:32,079
Okay! You got
all the money in the world.

2870
02:10:32,158 --> 02:10:33,751
You need everybody else's money?

2871
02:10:33,826 --> 02:10:35,248
- Of course not, Pops.
- Well?

2872
02:10:35,328 --> 02:10:37,672
- You know, I built it.
- I know you built it.

2873
02:10:37,747 --> 02:10:39,465
You built it, so now preserve it.

2874
02:11:10,696 --> 02:11:12,118
You know,

2875
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:15,209
five years ago,
when I started Stratton Oakmont

2876
02:11:15,284 --> 02:11:17,378
with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day

2877
02:11:17,453 --> 02:11:20,753
would eventually come
where I'd have to be moving on.

2878
02:11:22,708 --> 02:11:26,508
And it's truly with a heavy heart
that I'm here to say that...

2879
02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:30,303
That that day is finally here.

2880
02:11:34,512 --> 02:11:36,810
I wanna... I want
to thank you all for your...

2881
02:11:36,889 --> 02:11:39,563
Your years of loyalty and admiration.

2882
02:11:39,642 --> 02:11:41,110
But the point is this.

2883
02:11:42,061 --> 02:11:43,313
Under Donnie's leadership,

2884
02:11:43,396 --> 02:11:46,866
along with Nicky Koskoff
and Robbie Feinberg

2885
02:11:46,941 --> 02:11:49,740
moving into key management positions,
this place really

2886
02:11:49,819 --> 02:11:51,162
is gonna be better than ever!

2887
02:11:51,237 --> 02:11:53,365
That I promise you. Okay?

2888
02:11:53,739 --> 02:11:56,242
Give them a round of applause.
Come on.

2889
02:11:59,328 --> 02:12:02,081
This is Ellis Island here, people.

2890
02:12:02,164 --> 02:12:03,884
I don't care who you are,
where you're from,

2891
02:12:03,916 --> 02:12:06,419
whether your relatives
came over on the fucking Mayflower

2892
02:12:06,502 --> 02:12:08,675
or on an inner tube from Haiti,

2893
02:12:08,754 --> 02:12:11,007
this right here is the land of opportunity.

2894
02:12:11,090 --> 02:12:13,593
Stratton Oakmont is America!

2895
02:12:17,638 --> 02:12:19,265
All of you know Kimmie Belzer, right?

2896
02:12:19,348 --> 02:12:20,565
Yes, we do.

2897
02:12:20,641 --> 02:12:21,767
Fuck you.

2898
02:12:22,435 --> 02:12:23,652
Come on, Kimmie.

2899
02:12:23,727 --> 02:12:25,274
What you probably didn't know is,

2900
02:12:25,354 --> 02:12:27,152
Kimmie was one of
the first brokers here,

2901
02:12:27,231 --> 02:12:29,529
one of Stratton's original 20.

2902
02:12:30,276 --> 02:12:32,119
Now most of you met Kimmie,

2903
02:12:32,194 --> 02:12:35,198
the beautiful sophisticated woman
that she is today.

2904
02:12:35,614 --> 02:12:38,709
A woman that wears
$3,000 Armani suits.

2905
02:12:40,703 --> 02:12:43,252
Who drives a brand-new
Mercedes-Benz.

2906
02:12:43,956 --> 02:12:45,799
A woman who spends

2907
02:12:45,875 --> 02:12:47,297
her winters in the Bahamas

2908
02:12:47,376 --> 02:12:49,504
and summers in the Hamptons!

2909
02:12:54,508 --> 02:12:56,852
That's not the Kimmie that I met.

2910
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:03,435
The Kimmie that I met
didn't have two nickels to rub together.

2911
02:13:04,685 --> 02:13:06,938
She was a single mom
on the balls of her ass

2912
02:13:07,021 --> 02:13:08,819
with an eight-year-old son.

2913
02:13:08,898 --> 02:13:11,902
Okay? She was
three months behind on her rent.

2914
02:13:12,985 --> 02:13:16,660
And when she came to me
and asked me for a job,

2915
02:13:16,739 --> 02:13:18,958
she asked for a $5,000 advance

2916
02:13:19,033 --> 02:13:22,207
just so she could pay her son's tuition.

2917
02:13:26,665 --> 02:13:28,383
And what'd I do, Kimmie?

2918
02:13:28,459 --> 02:13:30,177
Go on, tell them.

2919
02:13:31,921 --> 02:13:33,969
You wrote me a check

2920
02:13:34,215 --> 02:13:36,309
for $25,000.

2921
02:13:37,593 --> 02:13:39,061
That's right.

2922
02:13:39,178 --> 02:13:40,521
Thank you.

2923
02:13:43,933 --> 02:13:45,685
And you know why that is?

2924
02:13:49,021 --> 02:13:51,319
It's because I believed in you.

2925
02:13:53,025 --> 02:13:55,744
It's because I believed in you, Kimmie,

2926
02:13:56,153 --> 02:14:00,033
just like I believe in each
and every one of you here today.

2927
02:14:00,115 --> 02:14:02,538
- I fucking love you, Jordan!
- I fucking love you.

2928
02:14:02,618 --> 02:14:04,416
I fucking love you! I love you.

2929
02:14:04,495 --> 02:14:07,294
I fucking love you, too!
I fucking love you, too!

2930
02:14:10,209 --> 02:14:12,211
And I love all of you!

2931
02:14:12,795 --> 02:14:15,139
And I love all of you
from the bottom of my heart.

2932
02:14:15,214 --> 02:14:17,683
- I fucking love you, too.
- I mean that.

2933
02:14:18,509 --> 02:14:20,807
You are the shit.
You are the fucking shit.

2934
02:14:27,309 --> 02:14:29,482
It's a shame, you know.

2935
02:14:31,063 --> 02:14:35,193
For years, I've been telling you guys
never to take no for an answer, right?

2936
02:14:35,276 --> 02:14:38,496
You know, to keep pushing,
to never hang up the phone

2937
02:14:39,405 --> 02:14:41,658
until you get what you want.

2938
02:14:42,533 --> 02:14:44,285
Because you all deserve it.

2939
02:14:46,328 --> 02:14:49,502
You know, this fucking deal
that I'm about to sign

2940
02:14:49,999 --> 02:14:52,127
barring me from the securities industry,

2941
02:14:52,209 --> 02:14:54,257
barring me from Stratton,

2942
02:14:55,337 --> 02:14:56,759
my home.

2943
02:14:59,508 --> 02:15:01,510
What the fuck is that, you know?

2944
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:05,064
I'll tell you what it is. It's...

2945
02:15:05,806 --> 02:15:08,605
It's me taking no
for an answer, you know.

2946
02:15:10,102 --> 02:15:11,354
It's them...

2947
02:15:11,437 --> 02:15:14,691
It's them selling me,
not the other way around.

2948
02:15:15,441 --> 02:15:18,160
It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.

2949
02:15:23,324 --> 02:15:24,576
So...

2950
02:15:31,707 --> 02:15:33,254
You know what?

2951
02:15:37,046 --> 02:15:38,673
I'm not leaving.

2952
02:15:41,008 --> 02:15:42,260
I'm not leaving.

2953
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:46,392
I'm not fucking leaving!

2954
02:15:51,435 --> 02:15:53,858
You're not getting a fucking promotion!

2955
02:15:55,230 --> 02:15:56,573
The show goes on!

2956
02:15:59,193 --> 02:16:00,615
This is my home!

2957
02:16:00,694 --> 02:16:03,447
They're gonna need
a fucking wrecking ball

2958
02:16:03,530 --> 02:16:05,407
to take me out of here!

2959
02:16:07,409 --> 02:16:09,912
They're gonna need to
send in the National Guard

2960
02:16:09,995 --> 02:16:11,747
or fucking SWAT team

2961
02:16:11,830 --> 02:16:14,333
'cause I ain't going nowhere!

2962
02:16:17,169 --> 02:16:18,216
Fuck them!

2963
02:16:20,673 --> 02:16:22,425
Fuck them!

2964
02:16:56,542 --> 02:16:58,340
Jordy! Jordy!

2965
02:16:58,460 --> 02:17:00,462
Jordy! Get back here!

2966
02:17:01,296 --> 02:17:02,468
Hey!

2967
02:17:04,925 --> 02:17:06,177
Give me that.

2968
02:17:08,679 --> 02:17:09,805
What is this?

2969
02:17:09,888 --> 02:17:12,391
Ramar of the Jungle, for Christ sake?

2970
02:17:13,475 --> 02:17:16,399
Paddy D, mazel tov, you Irishman.

2971
02:17:16,478 --> 02:17:19,948
Jordan Belfort just welched
on his deal with the SEC.

2972
02:17:20,023 --> 02:17:22,697
He is back in the ocean. Happy hunting.

2973
02:17:35,622 --> 02:17:37,920
It was our time to party big.

2974
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,628
And just as Brad
was released from jail, too.

2975
02:17:41,462 --> 02:17:45,433
I apologized, even offered to
pay him for his time in the can.

2976
02:17:46,008 --> 02:17:48,102
But he said no, that he was out.

2977
02:17:48,177 --> 02:17:50,054
He didn't want any part of us.

2978
02:17:50,137 --> 02:17:51,764
Sad thing was,

2979
02:17:51,847 --> 02:17:55,067
two years later he was dead.

2980
02:17:55,225 --> 02:17:57,648
Massive heart attack. Thirty-five.

2981
02:17:58,437 --> 02:18:00,781
Same age Mozart died.

2982
02:18:00,856 --> 02:18:04,110
Not that they have a hell
of a lot in common, but...

2983
02:18:04,193 --> 02:18:06,537
Anyway, I don't know
why that came to mind.

2984
02:18:08,697 --> 02:18:12,292
Within days, subpoenas started flying.

2985
02:18:12,367 --> 02:18:15,712
Notices to produce documents,
depositions, you name it.

2986
02:18:15,788 --> 02:18:17,790
Donnie couldn't drink water fast enough.

2987
02:18:17,873 --> 02:18:20,342
United States government
wants to give me a subpoena?

2988
02:18:20,417 --> 02:18:23,717
Here's what we do
with subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!

2989
02:18:29,468 --> 02:18:32,096
Fuck you, USA! Fuck you!

2990
02:18:32,179 --> 02:18:34,056
Fuck you! Fuck you!

2991
02:18:34,139 --> 02:18:35,937
Fuck you!

2992
02:18:43,690 --> 02:18:45,738
Jordan Belfort.

2993
02:18:45,818 --> 02:18:47,695
Alden. That's a nice name.

2994
02:18:47,778 --> 02:18:49,075
Thank you very much for that.

2995
02:18:49,154 --> 02:18:51,327
- What kind of name is that?
- That is my name.

2996
02:18:51,406 --> 02:18:53,079
I do not recall that.

2997
02:18:53,158 --> 02:18:55,502
I do not recall that. Okay?

2998
02:18:55,577 --> 02:18:57,750
Mr. Ming, thank you for coming in today.

2999
02:18:57,830 --> 02:18:59,457
Are you gonna finish
the rest of that Danish?

3000
02:18:59,540 --> 02:19:00,757
- Can I have that Danish?
- No, no, go ahead.

3001
02:19:00,833 --> 02:19:02,506
They interrogated everybody.

3002
02:19:02,584 --> 02:19:04,211
I got a low blood sugar, thyroid thing.

3003
02:19:04,294 --> 02:19:05,466
It went on for months.

3004
02:19:05,546 --> 02:19:07,594
It was a total fucking harassment.

3005
02:19:07,673 --> 02:19:09,234
Tell him to proceed with the questions.

3006
02:19:09,299 --> 02:19:11,768
But not a single Strattonite cracked.

3007
02:19:11,844 --> 02:19:13,517
Gladys Carrera?

3008
02:19:13,595 --> 02:19:15,142
Doesn't ring a bell.

3009
02:19:15,222 --> 02:19:17,850
Sorry, I have
no recommendation of that.

3010
02:19:18,016 --> 02:19:19,017
No.

3011
02:19:19,101 --> 02:19:20,102
No idea.

3012
02:19:20,185 --> 02:19:22,688
I don't recall that transaction.
You guys have any milk?

3013
02:19:22,771 --> 02:19:25,024
Absolutely not.

3014
02:19:25,107 --> 02:19:26,950
Francis Sortigi
you called so many times

3015
02:19:27,025 --> 02:19:29,244
I just thought you might remember that.

3016
02:19:29,319 --> 02:19:30,821
Would you remember any of those?

3017
02:19:30,904 --> 02:19:32,705
- I do not recall any of that.
- This Abdul...

3018
02:19:32,739 --> 02:19:34,912
I do not... No, I don't recall.

3019
02:19:34,992 --> 02:19:36,665
It was a long phone call.

3020
02:19:36,743 --> 02:19:38,416
I just wondered if you have
any memory of that.

3021
02:19:38,495 --> 02:19:41,669
Okay. You know we've talked to
several of the employees at this firm

3022
02:19:41,748 --> 02:19:45,048
and nobody can recall anything
about this Steve Madden IPO.

3023
02:19:45,127 --> 02:19:46,379
I think it's Odd.

3024
02:19:48,255 --> 02:19:50,758
Do you recall Cartage Corporation?

3025
02:19:52,259 --> 02:19:53,511
You do recall it?

3026
02:19:53,594 --> 02:19:54,891
No, I don't recall that at all.

3027
02:19:55,470 --> 02:19:58,394
Excuse me. I have to ask.
Is that your real hair?

3028
02:19:59,016 --> 02:20:01,144
Are you gonna say anything about that?

3029
02:20:01,226 --> 02:20:02,547
Are you gonna comment on my hair?

3030
02:20:02,603 --> 02:20:04,321
Is that how we're doing...
Is this personal questions?

3031
02:20:04,396 --> 02:20:06,069
I'm just wondering why you would
wear something like that.

3032
02:20:06,148 --> 02:20:07,991
Sorry. I don't recall that company.

3033
02:20:10,068 --> 02:20:11,820
Can I get you anything else, gentlemen?

3034
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:13,747
Yes. Sweetheart, I have a rare condition

3035
02:20:13,822 --> 02:20:17,247
which requires me to drink one of those
every 15 minutes, please.

3036
02:20:17,701 --> 02:20:20,830
We were specifically advised
not to leave the country.

3037
02:20:20,913 --> 02:20:22,961
So, we took our wives to Italy.

3038
02:20:23,332 --> 02:20:25,755
We figured we were safer
working from overseas

3039
02:20:25,834 --> 02:20:27,211
giving orders to Rugrat.

3040
02:20:27,294 --> 02:20:29,467
Nobody could arrest us
and nobody could prove

3041
02:20:29,546 --> 02:20:31,548
I was still running Stratton from a yacht.

3042
02:20:31,632 --> 02:20:32,884
Hey, Rugrat.

3043
02:20:32,966 --> 02:20:34,138
Bonjour.

3044
02:20:34,217 --> 02:20:36,219
You bald-headed eagle, how you doing?

3045
02:20:36,303 --> 02:20:37,270
Donnie, Donnie, listen!

3046
02:20:37,346 --> 02:20:38,643
We have a problem, okay.

3047
02:20:38,722 --> 02:20:41,976
Your friend, Steve Madden,
is unloading shares.

3048
02:20:42,059 --> 02:20:44,107
What are you saying?
Who told you that?

3049
02:20:44,186 --> 02:20:45,779
- What's going on?
- He's doing it, Donnie!

3050
02:20:45,854 --> 02:20:48,323
He said that
Steve Madden's unloading shares.

3051
02:20:48,398 --> 02:20:49,524
Who told you that? It's bullshit!

3052
02:20:49,608 --> 02:20:51,952
Give me that goddamn phone.

3053
02:20:52,027 --> 02:20:53,574
What's going on?

3054
02:20:53,779 --> 02:20:55,873
Jordan, look. I'm watching the screen

3055
02:20:55,948 --> 02:20:58,667
and huge chunks of Steve Madden
are being sold, okay.

3056
02:20:58,742 --> 02:21:00,790
It's not coming from us,
so it's gotta be Steve.

3057
02:21:00,869 --> 02:21:02,917
He's the only person
with that many shares.

3058
02:21:02,996 --> 02:21:03,963
It's Donnie. Call me back, all right.

3059
02:21:04,039 --> 02:21:06,383
Donnie, your little friend
is trying to fuck me, you know that.

3060
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:08,218
Your little friend is trying to
fuck me right in the ass.

3061
02:21:08,293 --> 02:21:09,886
- Get him on the phone now!
- We don't know anything yet.

3062
02:21:09,962 --> 02:21:11,339
Let's not jump to conclusions.

3063
02:21:11,838 --> 02:21:13,556
Even though I owned 85%

3064
02:21:13,632 --> 02:21:16,681
of Steve-cocksucking-
motherfucking-Madden Shoes,

3065
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:19,013
the shares were in his fucking name.

3066
02:21:19,096 --> 02:21:21,315
This motherfucker knew
I was in trouble with the feds

3067
02:21:21,390 --> 02:21:23,188
and was trying to take advantage.

3068
02:21:23,266 --> 02:21:24,768
Talk to me, man.
How do you wanna play this?

3069
02:21:24,851 --> 02:21:26,603
I want you to get
all our clients on the phone right now

3070
02:21:26,687 --> 02:21:27,984
and have them start
selling Steve Madden.

3071
02:21:28,063 --> 02:21:29,531
We're gonna drive
that fucking price down!

3072
02:21:29,606 --> 02:21:31,108
Do you hear me? Shut the fuck up!

3073
02:21:31,233 --> 02:21:32,993
This is your fucking friend
from high school.

3074
02:21:33,026 --> 02:21:35,120
If that little fucking prick
thinks he can fuck with me,

3075
02:21:35,195 --> 02:21:37,789
we'll turn his company
into a penny stock! You hear me?

3076
02:21:37,864 --> 02:21:39,286
- You got it?
- Yes. I got it!

3077
02:21:39,366 --> 02:21:42,290
Let's just not jump to conclusions
before we know what's going on.

3078
02:21:42,369 --> 02:21:43,746
Captain Ted!

3079
02:21:43,829 --> 02:21:44,921
Captain Ted!

3080
02:21:45,414 --> 02:21:47,792
Hang up your phones! Everybody, hey!

3081
02:21:47,874 --> 02:21:50,627
Turn the boat around!
We're going home!

3082
02:21:53,755 --> 02:21:56,133
Baby! Baby, what happened?

3083
02:21:56,425 --> 02:21:57,677
I just...

3084
02:21:58,093 --> 02:21:59,345
Sweetheart, what's going on?

3085
02:22:00,470 --> 02:22:02,097
Aunt Emma...

3086
02:22:02,973 --> 02:22:04,270
Just wait.

3087
02:22:04,683 --> 02:22:06,310
I can't...

3088
02:22:06,393 --> 02:22:09,272
What's going on? Why you crying?

3089
02:22:09,354 --> 02:22:11,402
- She's dead!
- Who? Who's dead?

3090
02:22:11,481 --> 02:22:13,859
I just got a call from my cousin Betty.

3091
02:22:13,942 --> 02:22:15,034
Yeah?

3092
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:16,828
Aunt Emma is dead.

3093
02:22:18,238 --> 02:22:20,957
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

3094
02:22:21,283 --> 02:22:22,455
You're serious?

3095
02:22:23,243 --> 02:22:25,541
Oh, my God! Baby, that's...

3096
02:22:25,620 --> 02:22:27,088
Oh, fuck!

3097
02:22:27,164 --> 02:22:28,962
Oh, sweetheart, that's just...

3098
02:22:29,041 --> 02:22:30,384
Fucking heart attack!

3099
02:22:30,459 --> 02:22:32,052
Boom, snap, gone.

3100
02:22:32,127 --> 02:22:33,970
Shufﬂed off her mortal coil.

3101
02:22:34,046 --> 02:22:37,391
And $20 million stuck
in a Swiss bank account.

3102
02:22:37,466 --> 02:22:39,560
The last time I talked
to her she was fine!

3103
02:22:39,634 --> 02:22:41,807
- She's not that old.
- Oh, God! Baby, oh, God!

3104
02:22:41,887 --> 02:22:44,060
That's so fucking terrible!

3105
02:22:44,139 --> 02:22:45,857
Oh, fuck!

3106
02:22:45,932 --> 02:22:46,933
It is terrible.

3107
02:22:47,017 --> 02:22:49,566
Your aunt was such an elegant,
attractive woman.

3108
02:22:49,644 --> 02:22:51,567
My condolences to you and your family.

3109
02:22:51,646 --> 02:22:52,989
Yes. We're absolutely devastated.

3110
02:22:53,065 --> 02:22:55,067
Thank you so much
for your condolences.

3111
02:22:55,150 --> 02:22:58,074
Now where does that leave us
in regard to her account exactly?

3112
02:22:58,153 --> 02:22:59,655
Does it go into probate or what?

3113
02:22:59,738 --> 02:23:01,331
Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry.

3114
02:23:01,406 --> 02:23:03,079
Your aunt, before she died,

3115
02:23:03,158 --> 02:23:06,082
signed a document
naming you as her successor.

3116
02:23:06,328 --> 02:23:07,830
She did?

3117
02:23:07,913 --> 02:23:09,540
Fantastic! Well, that's good news!

3118
02:23:09,831 --> 02:23:12,004
Well, not as of yet.

3119
02:23:12,334 --> 02:23:14,336
What does that mean? Not as of yet?

3120
02:23:16,755 --> 02:23:18,473
I can't seem to hear you.

3121
02:23:18,548 --> 02:23:21,267
I must have bad reception.
Are you speaking English?

3122
02:23:21,426 --> 02:23:24,100
- Very... Now. Fast. Very fast.
- Fast?

3123
02:23:24,179 --> 02:23:26,307
I have to get to Switzerland now?

3124
02:23:28,016 --> 02:23:30,110
Speak English! Fucking speak English!

3125
02:23:30,185 --> 02:23:31,482
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Quiet, okay?

3126
02:23:31,561 --> 02:23:33,041
Take your suit, take your dick, okay,

3127
02:23:33,105 --> 02:23:34,823
- and move your ass! Please.
- Okay.

3128
02:23:35,857 --> 02:23:36,904
Move my ass! Yes!

3129
02:23:36,983 --> 02:23:41,113
I gotta say, these Swiss were
some sneaky motherfuckers.

3130
02:23:41,196 --> 02:23:43,119
Within minutes,
he had me set up with a forger

3131
02:23:43,198 --> 02:23:45,200
who could fake Aunt Emma's signature.

3132
02:23:45,283 --> 02:23:46,830
You American shit!

3133
02:23:46,993 --> 02:23:50,372
I just had to get there by tomorrow,
or lose $20 million.

3134
02:23:50,455 --> 02:23:52,173
We're going to Monaco!

3135
02:23:52,707 --> 02:23:55,005
- Monaco? Now?
- Yes, baby.

3136
02:23:55,085 --> 02:23:57,679
We're going to Monaco,
so then we can go to Switzerland, okay?

3137
02:23:57,754 --> 02:23:59,472
- But her aunt just died.
- I realize that.

3138
02:23:59,548 --> 02:24:02,472
But I have business in Switzerland.
I need to go to Switzerland right now.

3139
02:24:02,551 --> 02:24:04,645
Bottom line. Sorry.

3140
02:24:04,928 --> 02:24:06,726
We gotta get to London.

3141
02:24:07,222 --> 02:24:08,474
Why? Why?

3142
02:24:09,975 --> 02:24:11,147
The funeral!

3143
02:24:11,226 --> 02:24:12,569
Yeah, but, babe. Look, look...

3144
02:24:13,061 --> 02:24:15,814
I loved your aunt
more than anyone in the entire world.

3145
02:24:15,897 --> 02:24:17,399
I really did.

3146
02:24:17,899 --> 02:24:20,152
But she's dead now, sweetie.

3147
02:24:20,235 --> 02:24:22,454
She's dead
and she's not going anywhere.

3148
02:24:22,529 --> 02:24:24,907
She'll still be dead by the time
we get to London, okay?

3149
02:24:25,574 --> 02:24:27,326
Captain Ted!
Captain Ted, all right, look.

3150
02:24:27,409 --> 02:24:29,207
We're going to Monaco.
Monaco now, okay?

3151
02:24:29,286 --> 02:24:30,333
Monaco, right.

3152
02:24:30,412 --> 02:24:32,289
We're going to Monaco
so that we can drive to Switzerland

3153
02:24:32,372 --> 02:24:33,733
so they don't stamp our passports.

3154
02:24:33,748 --> 02:24:35,625
Take care of business here,
we'll drive back to Monaco,

3155
02:24:35,709 --> 02:24:37,382
take a flight over to London
to catch the funeral

3156
02:24:37,460 --> 02:24:38,962
and be in New York
in three fucking business days!

3157
02:24:39,045 --> 02:24:40,217
That's the fucking plan.

3158
02:24:40,297 --> 02:24:42,675
I just want you to know that
we might run into some chop.

3159
02:24:42,757 --> 02:24:44,976
Chop? We can fucking
handle chop, right?

3160
02:24:45,051 --> 02:24:46,473
I mean, it's a 170-foot yacht.

3161
02:24:46,553 --> 02:24:49,306
No, no, no. We're not going anywhere
unless he says it's safe, all right.

3162
02:24:49,389 --> 02:24:50,811
- Don't worry about the chop.
- It's safe.

3163
02:24:50,891 --> 02:24:52,234
You don't know shit about chop.

3164
02:24:52,309 --> 02:24:54,528
Oh, really? And you do?
You're a fucking expert on that.

3165
02:24:54,603 --> 02:24:56,947
I'll chop your fucking credit card in half.
How about that?

3166
02:24:57,022 --> 02:24:58,899
Chop is fine. Trust me. Chop is fine.

3167
02:24:58,982 --> 02:25:00,700
Is chop fine, Captain Ted?

3168
02:25:02,027 --> 02:25:03,870
Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow.

3169
02:25:03,945 --> 02:25:05,185
Yeah, we're gonna take it slow.

3170
02:25:05,197 --> 02:25:06,790
It's a little uncomfortable.
Tell them it's safe.

3171
02:25:06,865 --> 02:25:08,037
It's gonna be safe.

3172
02:25:08,116 --> 02:25:11,711
We'll batten down the hatches
and secure the deck.

3173
02:25:11,786 --> 02:25:15,507
And we're looking at a few...
Maybe a few broken dishes.

3174
02:25:15,582 --> 02:25:16,708
Few broken dishes.

3175
02:25:16,791 --> 02:25:18,008
What's a few broken dishes?

3176
02:25:18,084 --> 02:25:19,381
Does that sound fucking awesome
or what?

3177
02:25:19,461 --> 02:25:20,838
No. Not really.

3178
02:25:20,921 --> 02:25:22,218
We're gonna have a fucking good time!

3179
02:25:22,297 --> 02:25:24,049
Let's go to fucking Monaco now!

3180
02:25:24,132 --> 02:25:25,304
Let's fucking move! Let's go!

3181
02:25:30,722 --> 02:25:31,769
Hold on!

3182
02:25:34,935 --> 02:25:37,939
What the fuck is going on out here?

3183
02:25:38,021 --> 02:25:40,649
The Jet Skis just went overboard!

3184
02:25:40,732 --> 02:25:42,734
Oh, Jesus Christ! Honey, you okay?

3185
02:25:42,817 --> 02:25:44,945
Gale warning! Gale warning!

3186
02:25:45,028 --> 02:25:47,827
The waves are
20 feet high and building!

3187
02:25:47,906 --> 02:25:49,626
Turn around, let's go
the other fucking way.

3188
02:25:49,658 --> 02:25:50,875
- We can't!
- Go!

3189
02:25:50,951 --> 02:25:53,545
We'll get broad-sided. It'll tip over!

3190
02:25:53,620 --> 02:25:55,418
I am a master diver. You hear that?

3191
02:25:55,497 --> 02:25:56,544
I'm a master diver!

3192
02:25:56,623 --> 02:25:57,875
No one's gonna fucking die!

3193
02:25:57,958 --> 02:26:00,586
I got you, baby. I got you.
Trust me, okay?

3194
02:26:00,669 --> 02:26:01,921
I love you.

3195
02:26:02,003 --> 02:26:03,926
I love you, baby. Just hold on tight.

3196
02:26:04,005 --> 02:26:05,052
Okay.

3197
02:26:05,131 --> 02:26:06,178
Donnie!

3198
02:26:07,759 --> 02:26:08,976
Hold on, baby!

3199
02:26:09,052 --> 02:26:10,053
Donnie!

3200
02:26:12,097 --> 02:26:13,144
Donnie!

3201
02:26:13,640 --> 02:26:15,017
- What?
- Hold on, baby.

3202
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,602
Get the fucking ludes.

3203
02:26:16,685 --> 02:26:17,857
I don't wanna die, Jordan!

3204
02:26:17,936 --> 02:26:20,655
I did a lot of bad shit.
I'm going to hell, Jordan!

3205
02:26:20,730 --> 02:26:23,609
I fucked up! I fucked up so bad!

3206
02:26:23,692 --> 02:26:25,694
Get the ludes! Downstairs!

3207
02:26:25,902 --> 02:26:27,119
What are you saying?

3208
02:26:27,612 --> 02:26:29,034
Fuck!

3209
02:26:29,906 --> 02:26:31,123
Get the ludes!

3210
02:26:31,199 --> 02:26:32,792
I can't go down there, Jordan.
It's flooded.

3211
02:26:32,867 --> 02:26:34,119
It's three feet of water down there!

3212
02:26:34,202 --> 02:26:36,955
I will not die sober!

3213
02:26:37,038 --> 02:26:38,790
Get those fucking ludes!

3214
02:26:38,873 --> 02:26:39,920
Okay!

3215
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,343
- Go!
"Okay

3216
02:26:44,212 --> 02:26:45,964
- Where's he going?
- Hold on, baby!

3217
02:26:46,047 --> 02:26:47,640
Donnie! Is he fucking crazy?

3218
02:26:47,716 --> 02:26:48,842
He's just warning everybody!

3219
02:27:01,062 --> 02:27:02,780
Jesus Christ!

3220
02:27:04,357 --> 02:27:05,529
Hold on!

3221
02:27:05,608 --> 02:27:07,076
Get away from the window!

3222
02:27:07,152 --> 02:27:08,529
Rogue wave!

3223
02:27:08,611 --> 02:27:09,658
Mayday!

3224
02:27:09,738 --> 02:27:12,332
This is Captain Ted Beecham
aboard the yacht Naomi!

3225
02:27:12,407 --> 02:27:13,909
- We are going down!
- I got 'em!

3226
02:27:14,367 --> 02:27:15,584
I got 'em!

3227
02:27:16,745 --> 02:27:18,292
Give me one for the nerves!

3228
02:27:18,371 --> 02:27:19,497
We're going down!

3229
02:27:19,581 --> 02:27:21,800
This is a fucking Mayday!

3230
02:27:21,875 --> 02:27:23,969
We require immediate assistance!

3231
02:27:26,212 --> 02:27:27,213
Hold on!

3232
02:27:27,297 --> 02:27:28,514
Watch out!

3233
02:27:40,185 --> 02:27:42,734
The nice thing about
getting rescued by Italians

3234
02:27:43,021 --> 02:27:46,571
is that they feed you,
make you drink red wine,

3235
02:27:46,649 --> 02:27:48,617
then you get to dance.

3236
02:28:05,210 --> 02:28:06,883
Did you see that?

3237
02:28:07,295 --> 02:28:10,219
That was the plane
I sent to come get us.

3238
02:28:11,132 --> 02:28:14,887
I shit you not, it exploded
when a seagull ﬂew into the engine.

3239
02:28:14,969 --> 02:28:16,971
Three people killed.

3240
02:28:21,142 --> 02:28:22,985
You want a sign from God?

3241
02:28:23,061 --> 02:28:26,156
Well, after all this,
I finally got the message.

3242
02:28:31,611 --> 02:28:35,241
Do you dream of becoming
financially independent

3243
02:28:35,323 --> 02:28:37,997
but struggle every month
just to pay your bills?

3244
02:28:38,076 --> 02:28:42,172
Would you like to own a home like this,
but can barely afford to pay your rent?

3245
02:28:42,247 --> 02:28:45,968
My name is Jordan Belfort,
and there's no secret to wealth creation.

3246
02:28:46,042 --> 02:28:48,545
No matter who you are,
no matter where you came from,

3247
02:28:48,628 --> 02:28:51,222
you too can become
financially independent

3248
02:28:51,297 --> 02:28:53,049
in just a matter of months.

3249
02:28:53,133 --> 02:28:55,261
All you need is a strategy.

3250
02:28:55,343 --> 02:28:56,970
When I was 24 years old,

3251
02:28:57,053 --> 02:29:00,899
I made a decision
not just to survive, but to thrive.

3252
02:29:00,974 --> 02:29:03,443
At first I didn't feel like
deals like these were possible.

3253
02:29:03,518 --> 02:29:06,943
But we have the house
and we have a $33,000 profit.

3254
02:29:07,021 --> 02:29:08,147
I certainly believe now.

3255
02:29:08,231 --> 02:29:09,653
Think about it for a second.

3256
02:29:09,732 --> 02:29:11,860
If you don't have the guts
to attend Jordan Belfort's

3257
02:29:11,943 --> 02:29:14,116
Straight Line Persuasion
System seminar,

3258
02:29:14,195 --> 02:29:15,796
then how do you expect
to make any money?

3259
02:29:15,864 --> 02:29:19,619
If you want to be a millionaire someday,
have some guts. Make a decision.

3260
02:29:19,701 --> 02:29:22,454
Jordan Belfort's setup worked for me
because I worked hard for it.

3261
02:29:22,537 --> 02:29:25,086
And if it doesn't work for you,
it's because you're lazy.

3262
02:29:25,165 --> 02:29:26,792
And you should get a job at McDonald's.

3263
02:29:26,875 --> 02:29:29,298
There's nobody holding you back
from financial freedom.

3264
02:29:29,377 --> 02:29:32,301
And there's nobody stopping you
from making millions.

3265
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:33,632
Don't just sit at home,

3266
02:29:33,715 --> 02:29:36,343
or the life of your dreams
will sail right past you.

3267
02:29:39,095 --> 02:29:42,725
I changed all these people's lives
and I can change yours, too!

3268
02:29:42,807 --> 02:29:44,059
So come to my seminar!

3269
02:29:44,142 --> 02:29:45,519
The life of your dreams is only...

3270
02:29:45,602 --> 02:29:47,320
Good to see you again, Jordan.

3271
02:29:47,395 --> 02:29:48,487
You're under arrest!

3272
02:29:48,563 --> 02:29:50,156
You gotta be joking!

3273
02:29:51,399 --> 02:29:52,651
You're kidding me.

3274
02:29:52,734 --> 02:29:54,327
Hey, get the fuck away from me!

3275
02:29:54,402 --> 02:29:55,654
Turn that camera off.

3276
02:29:55,737 --> 02:29:57,739
I'm fucking shooting
a fucking infomercial here,

3277
02:29:57,822 --> 02:29:59,199
you fucking cocksucker!

3278
02:29:59,282 --> 02:30:01,000
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!
- Shut the fucking camera off.

3279
02:30:01,075 --> 02:30:02,827
You don't got shit on me, you hear me!

3280
02:30:02,911 --> 02:30:04,003
Go fuck yourself!

3281
02:30:04,078 --> 02:30:06,456
I'm making an honest living,
you fucking piece of shit!

3282
02:30:06,539 --> 02:30:09,509
Hey, Jordan,
let me give you a little legal advice.

3283
02:30:09,584 --> 02:30:11,006
Shut the fuck up!

3284
02:30:11,085 --> 02:30:12,632
Oh, fuck you, you fucking prick!

3285
02:30:12,712 --> 02:30:15,261
I'm making an honest living,
you motherfucker!

3286
02:30:17,091 --> 02:30:18,513
I clean up my act.

3287
02:30:18,593 --> 02:30:21,187
I did rehab. I'm a TV personality.

3288
02:30:21,262 --> 02:30:24,015
I'm sober for two years.
And this happens!

3289
02:30:24,098 --> 02:30:26,317
Rugrat goes
and gets busted down in Miami.

3290
02:30:26,392 --> 02:30:27,644
I'm Swiss, I'm not communist.

3291
02:30:27,727 --> 02:30:29,400
And guess who the fuck with? Saurel.

3292
02:30:29,479 --> 02:30:30,526
- You gonna beat me?
- No, sir.

3293
02:30:30,605 --> 02:30:32,858
Yeah, I know your country.
You're gonna beat me.

3294
02:30:32,941 --> 02:30:34,693
I mean, what are the fucking odds?

3295
02:30:34,776 --> 02:30:37,404
There had to be 10,000
Swiss bankers in Geneva,

3296
02:30:37,487 --> 02:30:41,287
and Rugrat gets the one dumb enough
to get himself arrested on U.S. soil.

3297
02:30:41,366 --> 02:30:42,743
I know.

3298
02:30:42,867 --> 02:30:44,244
I'm so sorry.

3299
02:30:46,454 --> 02:30:47,671
Even more fucked

3300
02:30:47,747 --> 02:30:50,876
was that he got busted
for shit that had nothing to do with me.

3301
02:30:50,959 --> 02:30:52,552
It had nothing to fucking do with me.

3302
02:30:52,627 --> 02:30:54,595
Something about laundering drug money

3303
02:30:54,671 --> 02:30:57,766
through offshore boat racing
and a guy named Rocky Aoki,

3304
02:30:57,840 --> 02:30:59,968
you know, the founder of Benihana.

3305
02:31:00,051 --> 02:31:01,394
Benihana.

3306
02:31:01,469 --> 02:31:03,142
Beni-fucking-hana!

3307
02:31:03,596 --> 02:31:05,348
Beni-fucking-hana!

3308
02:31:05,431 --> 02:31:06,398
Why?

3309
02:31:06,474 --> 02:31:07,851
Why, Why, God?

3310
02:31:07,934 --> 02:31:09,402
Why would you be so cruel

3311
02:31:09,477 --> 02:31:12,071
as to choose
a chain of fucking hibachi restaurants

3312
02:31:12,146 --> 02:31:13,398
to take me down?

3313
02:31:15,817 --> 02:31:18,286
Long story short. Saurel rats me out.

3314
02:31:18,361 --> 02:31:21,490
But not before he rats out
Brad's wife, Chantalle,

3315
02:31:21,573 --> 02:31:25,669
who, it turns out, he'd been fucking
every time she went to Switzerland!

3316
02:31:27,662 --> 02:31:30,165
- No, no, no, it's impossible.
- Oui, oui, oui.

3317
02:31:32,375 --> 02:31:34,173
All right!

3318
02:31:34,252 --> 02:31:37,756
One count engaging in conspiracy
to commit securities fraud.

3319
02:31:37,839 --> 02:31:40,058
Two counts securities fraud.

3320
02:31:40,133 --> 02:31:43,603
One count engaging in conspiracy
to commit money laundering.

3321
02:31:43,678 --> 02:31:45,931
Twenty-one counts money laundering.

3322
02:31:46,014 --> 02:31:48,392
One count obstruction of justice.

3323
02:31:49,434 --> 02:31:51,653
Bail is set at $10 million.

3324
02:32:06,868 --> 02:32:08,461
Uncle Donnie's here!

3325
02:32:09,245 --> 02:32:11,498
Rocky. How you doing?

3326
02:32:12,790 --> 02:32:14,463
I hate that fucking dog.

3327
02:32:14,542 --> 02:32:16,886
Yeah, he's getting old and decrepit.

3328
02:32:16,961 --> 02:32:18,463
Starting to shit in the house again.

3329
02:32:18,546 --> 02:32:20,264
- Me, too.
- Come here, buddy.

3330
02:32:20,340 --> 02:32:21,637
Ah, fuck.

3331
02:32:21,716 --> 02:32:23,343
- It's good to see you, pal.
- Yeah, you, too.

3332
02:32:23,426 --> 02:32:24,643
Good to see you.

3333
02:32:24,719 --> 02:32:27,222
Sit down. Oh, man.

3334
02:32:29,098 --> 02:32:30,395
How you doing, brother?

3335
02:32:31,225 --> 02:32:32,727
You know.

3336
02:32:32,810 --> 02:32:34,483
Shitty, pal.

3337
02:32:34,562 --> 02:32:36,690
But I'm hanging in there.

3338
02:32:38,024 --> 02:32:40,527
My new piece of jewelry. Check that out.

3339
02:32:40,610 --> 02:32:42,988
Can't leave the house, you know?

3340
02:32:43,071 --> 02:32:45,665
Starting to get cabin fever already.

3341
02:32:46,240 --> 02:32:47,787
Fucking Rugrat.

3342
02:32:48,368 --> 02:32:49,665
That wig-wearing faggot.

3343
02:32:49,744 --> 02:32:51,872
I can't believe that fucking guy.
I wanna kill him.

3344
02:32:51,954 --> 02:32:54,548
Swear to God,
I want to choke him to death.

3345
02:32:54,624 --> 02:32:56,922
Irresponsible little prick.

3346
02:32:57,043 --> 02:32:58,090
I'll tell you one thing.

3347
02:33:00,463 --> 02:33:02,966
I'm never eating at Benihana again.

3348
02:33:03,841 --> 02:33:06,014
I don't care whose birthday it is.

3349
02:33:07,428 --> 02:33:08,975
Where's Naomi? How's she doing?

3350
02:33:09,764 --> 02:33:11,061
That's her in the house there.

3351
02:33:11,140 --> 02:33:13,140
You could say hi,
but she probably won't wave back.

3352
02:33:13,351 --> 02:33:14,978
Naomi, sweetheart!

3353
02:33:18,439 --> 02:33:19,691
What's up her ass?

3354
02:33:19,774 --> 02:33:21,321
- Is she mad at me?
- No, you know...

3355
02:33:21,401 --> 02:33:22,881
We probably have
to mortgage the house

3356
02:33:22,944 --> 02:33:24,742
in order to make bail.

3357
02:33:24,821 --> 02:33:28,542
Probably end up selling the thing
in order to pay for all the lawyers.

3358
02:33:28,616 --> 02:33:31,085
It's been a nightmare, buddy,
to tell you the truth.

3359
02:33:31,327 --> 02:33:33,045
What are you gonna do, right?

3360
02:33:33,830 --> 02:33:36,674
Anyway, how's Stratton?
That's more important.

3361
02:33:36,749 --> 02:33:37,841
How's morale?

3362
02:33:37,917 --> 02:33:40,545
They all pissed off 'cause they have
to make money legally now?

3363
02:33:40,628 --> 02:33:42,096
Jordan.

3364
02:33:42,463 --> 02:33:44,886
I got the founding partners together.

3365
02:33:44,966 --> 02:33:47,389
I talked to them about everything.

3366
02:33:48,136 --> 02:33:49,137
And I got you.

3367
02:33:49,971 --> 02:33:51,564
What do you mean, you got me?

3368
02:33:52,724 --> 02:33:55,477
The house, money,
don't worry about it. I got you.

3369
02:34:01,482 --> 02:34:02,574
All right.

3370
02:34:02,650 --> 02:34:03,617
I love you, buddy.

3371
02:34:03,693 --> 02:34:05,616
- You know I'd do it for you, right?
- I know.

3372
02:34:05,695 --> 02:34:07,663
- You know that, right?
- I know.

3373
02:34:08,656 --> 02:34:09,782
I could fucking kiss you all over.

3374
02:34:09,866 --> 02:34:11,038
All right, enough, enough.

3375
02:34:13,119 --> 02:34:14,245
You want a beer, pal?

3376
02:34:14,328 --> 02:34:15,580
What are you drinking?

3377
02:34:15,663 --> 02:34:17,757
I got this non-alcoholic shit.

3378
02:34:17,832 --> 02:34:19,049
What's that?

3379
02:34:19,125 --> 02:34:22,129
A non-alcoholic beer. It's got no alcohol.

3380
02:34:22,211 --> 02:34:24,509
- It's a beer?
- Yeah, with no alcohol.

3381
02:34:25,047 --> 02:34:26,299
But if you drink enough,

3382
02:34:26,382 --> 02:34:28,305
if you drink a lot,
they get you fucked up?

3383
02:34:28,384 --> 02:34:30,478
No, there's no alcohol.
That's the fucking point.

3384
02:34:30,553 --> 02:34:31,600
I'm not a scientist.

3385
02:34:31,679 --> 02:34:32,851
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

3386
02:34:32,930 --> 02:34:34,523
I can get you a beer
if you want a fucking beer.

3387
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:36,768
I know, but I don't drink. You remember?

3388
02:34:36,851 --> 02:34:38,068
I don't drink anymore.

3389
02:34:38,144 --> 02:34:40,613
Oh, you wanna go inside
and blow some lines of baking powder?

3390
02:34:40,688 --> 02:34:41,860
Or baking soda...

3391
02:34:42,648 --> 02:34:44,946
Can't imagine ever not enjoying
getting fucked up.

3392
02:34:45,026 --> 02:34:46,448
- Yeah.
- I love it.

3393
02:34:46,527 --> 02:34:48,074
How's being sober?

3394
02:34:48,154 --> 02:34:49,997
- Fucking sucks.
- Boring, right?

3395
02:34:50,072 --> 02:34:52,495
So boring. I wanna kill myself.

3396
02:34:53,034 --> 02:34:55,583
There's a term,
and we don't like to use it

3397
02:34:55,661 --> 02:34:57,129
unless circumstances dictate,

3398
02:34:57,205 --> 02:34:59,173
and I think they do dictate in this case,

3399
02:34:59,248 --> 02:35:00,670
and the term is "Grenada."

3400
02:35:00,750 --> 02:35:02,297
Have you ever heard of Grenada?

3401
02:35:02,376 --> 02:35:03,423
No. No, I haven't.

3402
02:35:03,544 --> 02:35:07,048
Grenada's very interesting because
it is a small island nation

3403
02:35:07,131 --> 02:35:10,681
that was invaded by
the United States of America in 1983.

3404
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:12,854
It's about 90,000 people.

3405
02:35:12,929 --> 02:35:15,182
And essentially, it means

3406
02:35:15,932 --> 02:35:17,934
this case is unloseable.

3407
02:35:18,017 --> 02:35:19,109
Okay?

3408
02:35:19,185 --> 02:35:20,778
So, you know, we can come in,

3409
02:35:20,853 --> 02:35:22,696
we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants.

3410
02:35:22,772 --> 02:35:23,944
Nobody gives a fuck.

3411
02:35:24,023 --> 02:35:25,570
I'm gonna win.

3412
02:35:25,733 --> 02:35:27,110
You, sir.

3413
02:35:28,653 --> 02:35:30,405
Are what's known

3414
02:35:31,405 --> 02:35:32,622
as a Grenada.

3415
02:35:35,743 --> 02:35:38,087
You're looking at real prison time.

3416
02:35:39,247 --> 02:35:41,591
Money laundering
can get you as much as 20 years.

3417
02:35:42,583 --> 02:35:45,257
And our case couldn't be stronger
if we caught you

3418
02:35:45,336 --> 02:35:47,009
shoving cash in your mattress.

3419
02:35:47,088 --> 02:35:48,135
Is that right?

3420
02:35:49,006 --> 02:35:51,429
Hey, Jordan. Jordan.

3421
02:35:52,134 --> 02:35:55,980
Your rotting away in jail
till your kids get out of college,

3422
02:35:56,055 --> 02:35:57,682
that's not our ambition here.

3423
02:35:59,100 --> 02:36:01,649
There's other people
involved in this, too.

3424
02:36:01,727 --> 02:36:04,856
We think they need
to see their day in court as well.

3425
02:36:07,441 --> 02:36:09,489
Why do I sense
there's an offer in the air?

3426
02:36:09,569 --> 02:36:12,243
Look at him. He's got a sense.
What are you, Kreskin?

3427
02:36:13,447 --> 02:36:16,200
Full cooperation. He provides us
with a comprehensive list

3428
02:36:16,284 --> 02:36:18,662
of all the co-conspirators
spanning the last seven years,

3429
02:36:18,744 --> 02:36:20,712
and he also agrees to wear a wire.

3430
02:36:20,788 --> 02:36:22,040
Wait...

3431
02:36:22,123 --> 02:36:23,875
Did you just say "wear a wire"?

3432
02:36:23,958 --> 02:36:25,210
A wire.

3433
02:36:25,293 --> 02:36:26,670
What does that mean?

3434
02:36:26,752 --> 02:36:28,595
You want me to rat? Is that it?

3435
02:36:28,671 --> 02:36:29,968
No, I want you to cooperate.

3436
02:36:30,047 --> 02:36:31,970
- No. You want me to rat, right?
- Yes. We want you to rat.

3437
02:36:32,049 --> 02:36:35,895
That's fucking exactly
what we want you to do. To rat.

3438
02:36:39,974 --> 02:36:41,817
How was Cristy's party?

3439
02:36:41,893 --> 02:36:42,985
Fine.

3440
02:36:43,060 --> 02:36:44,437
Good.

3441
02:36:45,605 --> 02:36:48,074
Babe, I spoke
to the lawyers again today.

3442
02:36:48,149 --> 02:36:50,823
I have some really, really great news.

3443
02:36:52,653 --> 02:36:55,202
Turns out you're completely
off the hook, honey.

3444
02:36:56,157 --> 02:36:57,830
I know that already.

3445
02:36:57,909 --> 02:36:59,411
Right. Exactly.

3446
02:36:59,493 --> 02:37:02,713
You never did anything wrong
in the first place, right?

3447
02:37:03,664 --> 02:37:05,883
It turns out, all the FBI really

3448
02:37:06,542 --> 02:37:10,217
wants from me is to cooperate.

3449
02:37:10,463 --> 02:37:11,680
You know?

3450
02:37:11,756 --> 02:37:14,760
Turns out I have so much information
about the stock market and Wall Street,

3451
02:37:14,842 --> 02:37:16,683
I could save the government
years of heartache,

3452
02:37:16,719 --> 02:37:19,347
not to mention countless dollars.

3453
02:37:20,848 --> 02:37:23,192
But it gets even better, babe.

3454
02:37:23,643 --> 02:37:26,192
Because if I do decide to cooperate,

3455
02:37:26,562 --> 02:37:29,406
I might only be looking
at four short years,

3456
02:37:29,482 --> 02:37:30,950
in which case, you know,

3457
02:37:31,025 --> 02:37:34,074
we could start fresh,
maybe sell the house.

3458
02:37:34,153 --> 02:37:35,780
And any fines that I'd have to pay

3459
02:37:35,863 --> 02:37:37,661
wouldn't be due
till after I serve my term,

3460
02:37:37,740 --> 02:37:40,038
so we'd still have plenty
of money left over, you know?

3461
02:37:42,703 --> 02:37:45,126
The only thing that
of course bummed me out a little bit

3462
02:37:45,206 --> 02:37:50,258
is this whole idea of having to
give information about my friends.

3463
02:37:50,336 --> 02:37:53,556
Like you said, "There's no friends
on Wall Street." Right?

3464
02:37:53,631 --> 02:37:55,599
Right. Right. Exactly.

3465
02:37:55,675 --> 02:37:57,268
There's a silver lining
to that, too, honey.

3466
02:37:57,343 --> 02:37:59,016
Because they said eventually...

3467
02:37:59,095 --> 02:38:01,974
Eventually everyone's gonna have
to give information on this case.

3468
02:38:02,056 --> 02:38:04,855
So, at the end of the day, it might
not even be a factor. You know?

3469
02:38:04,934 --> 02:38:07,062
Well, that's good news. Right?

3470
02:38:07,186 --> 02:38:08,904
Yeah, yeah.

3471
02:38:08,980 --> 02:38:10,698
I'm really happy for you.

3472
02:38:12,066 --> 02:38:15,320
What do you mean,
happy for me, sweetheart?

3473
02:38:16,237 --> 02:38:18,831
You should be happy for
the both of us. Right?

3474
02:38:18,906 --> 02:38:20,874
- Yeah, right.
- All right.

3475
02:38:22,952 --> 02:38:24,579
Come here, baby.

3476
02:38:25,079 --> 02:38:26,626
Give me a kiss, sweetheart.

3477
02:38:26,706 --> 02:38:27,707
Jordan...

3478
02:38:27,790 --> 02:38:29,007
Oh, come on, baby.

3479
02:38:29,083 --> 02:38:31,302
I haven't made love to you
in so long. Please.

3480
02:38:31,377 --> 02:38:33,800
- No. Jordan, stop it.
- Come on, honey, please.

3481
02:38:33,879 --> 02:38:35,301
No! Jordan, stop it!

3482
02:38:37,049 --> 02:38:39,268
I've loved you
since the moment I saw you.

3483
02:38:43,139 --> 02:38:45,016
I fucking hate you, Jordan.

3484
02:38:45,599 --> 02:38:48,148
- Get off me!
- Baby... Don't do that.

3485
02:38:49,020 --> 02:38:50,943
You know how much I love you, right?

3486
02:38:51,439 --> 02:38:53,612
Stop that, sweetie. Please.

3487
02:38:58,863 --> 02:39:00,911
You wanna fuck me, Jordan?

3488
02:39:02,658 --> 02:39:04,376
You wanna fuck me?

3489
02:39:05,369 --> 02:39:06,495
Good.

3490
02:39:06,579 --> 02:39:07,922
Go ahead.

3491
02:39:08,414 --> 02:39:10,337
Go ahead and fuck me.

3492
02:39:11,417 --> 02:39:13,840
I want you to fuck me real hard.

3493
02:39:13,961 --> 02:39:16,635
I want you to fuck me like
it's the last fucking time.

3494
02:39:16,714 --> 02:39:18,057
- Why are you moving like that?
- Come on.

3495
02:39:18,132 --> 02:39:19,099
Please hold still.

3496
02:39:19,175 --> 02:39:20,736
'Cause I want you to come for me, baby.

3497
02:39:20,801 --> 02:39:22,144
Come on, babe.

3498
02:39:22,219 --> 02:39:23,721
Come for me, baby.

3499
02:39:23,804 --> 02:39:25,021
I want you to come for me

3500
02:39:25,097 --> 02:39:26,565
like it's the last fucking time.

3501
02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:28,108
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3502
02:39:28,184 --> 02:39:30,778
Come on, baby. Come for me.
Come for me, baby.

3503
02:39:30,853 --> 02:39:31,979
Come on, baby.

3504
02:39:32,063 --> 02:39:33,406
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3505
02:39:33,481 --> 02:39:35,441
- Yeah, baby, come.
- You want me to come for you?

3506
02:39:35,483 --> 02:39:36,655
Yeah.

3507
02:39:37,485 --> 02:39:39,453
- You want me to come for you?
- Yeah!

3508
02:39:39,528 --> 02:39:41,872
Huh? You want me to come for you?

3509
02:39:43,699 --> 02:39:45,417
Oh, God, baby. Yeah!

3510
02:39:45,493 --> 02:39:47,996
Oh, God. Oh, God.

3511
02:39:49,330 --> 02:39:51,674
Oh, God.

3512
02:39:52,333 --> 02:39:53,755
Oh, God.

3513
02:39:53,834 --> 02:39:55,086
Jesus.

3514
02:39:58,714 --> 02:40:00,057
On, baby.

3515
02:40:00,132 --> 02:40:02,635
That was so fucking great!

3516
02:40:02,718 --> 02:40:04,015
Oh, God!

3517
02:40:06,347 --> 02:40:08,315
That was the last time.

3518
02:40:08,808 --> 02:40:10,776
What do you mean, baby?

3519
02:40:10,851 --> 02:40:13,821
I mean that was the last time
we ever have sex.

3520
02:40:14,814 --> 02:40:16,862
What are you talking about?

3521
02:40:18,859 --> 02:40:20,532
I want a divorce.

3522
02:40:22,113 --> 02:40:24,115
What do you mean, you want a divorce?

3523
02:40:24,198 --> 02:40:26,246
What's that supposed to mean,
you want a divorce?

3524
02:40:26,325 --> 02:40:28,202
Get off me! I want a divorce.

3525
02:40:28,536 --> 02:40:29,788
You just made love to me.

3526
02:40:29,870 --> 02:40:30,962
What the fuck is wrong with you?

3527
02:40:31,038 --> 02:40:33,382
I don't love you anymore, Jordan!

3528
02:40:34,667 --> 02:40:36,635
Oh, you don't love me?

3529
02:40:37,044 --> 02:40:38,637
You don't love me anymore, huh?

3530
02:40:38,712 --> 02:40:40,965
Well, isn't that just fucking
convenient for you!

3531
02:40:41,048 --> 02:40:42,891
Now that I'm under federal indictment,

3532
02:40:42,967 --> 02:40:44,935
with an electronic bracelet
around my ankle,

3533
02:40:45,010 --> 02:40:46,728
now you decide you don't
fucking love me anymore.

3534
02:40:46,804 --> 02:40:48,556
- Is that right?
- No, no.

3535
02:40:48,889 --> 02:40:51,142
What kind of person are you? Tell me.

3536
02:40:51,225 --> 02:40:52,477
You married me!

3537
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:54,080
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

3538
02:40:54,145 --> 02:40:55,818
Jordan, this is how it's gonna go.

3539
02:40:55,896 --> 02:40:58,069
I'm gonna take custody of the kids.

3540
02:40:58,149 --> 02:41:01,699
If you agree to the divorce right now,
I will allow visitation.

3541
02:41:01,819 --> 02:41:03,662
- Okay? Don't try to fight it.
- Oh, my God.

3542
02:41:03,737 --> 02:41:07,913
It'll save us both a lot of money
and I got a feeling you're gonna need it.

3543
02:41:09,451 --> 02:41:12,671
You're not taking my kids, sweetheart.
You hear me?

3544
02:41:12,746 --> 02:41:14,168
I've already talked to the lawyer.

3545
02:41:14,248 --> 02:41:15,500
He said even if you don't get convicted,

3546
02:41:15,583 --> 02:41:16,675
I've got a good chance of getting them.

3547
02:41:16,750 --> 02:41:17,842
I got news for you.

3548
02:41:17,918 --> 02:41:21,343
You're not fucking taking my children,
you vicious fucking cunt, you!

3549
02:41:21,881 --> 02:41:23,849
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

3550
02:41:23,924 --> 02:41:26,097
You're not fucking taking
my goddamn fucking kids!

3551
02:41:26,177 --> 02:41:27,554
You hear me? Fuck you!

3552
02:41:27,761 --> 02:41:30,514
You're not fucking
taking my fucking kids!

3553
02:41:39,106 --> 02:41:40,904
Fucking bitch!

3554
02:41:43,360 --> 02:41:44,737
Fucking whore!

3555
02:41:49,116 --> 02:41:51,790
Fucking bitch!
Piece of shit fucking whore!

3556
02:42:00,961 --> 02:42:03,714
Look at yourself, Jordan.

3557
02:42:03,797 --> 02:42:04,969
You're sick!

3558
02:42:05,049 --> 02:42:06,221
You're a sick man!

3559
02:42:06,300 --> 02:42:08,348
Fuck you! I told you,
you're not taking my fucking kids!

3560
02:42:08,427 --> 02:42:10,896
You think I would let my kids near you?

3561
02:42:10,971 --> 02:42:12,143
Look at yourself!

3562
02:42:12,223 --> 02:42:13,725
You know what my lawyer said?

3563
02:42:13,807 --> 02:42:17,277
My lawyer said that you're going
to prison for 20 years, Jordan.

3564
02:42:17,353 --> 02:42:20,607
Twenty fucking years!
You're never gonna see the kids again!

3565
02:42:20,689 --> 02:42:21,906
You don't think I'm not gonna see my...

3566
02:42:21,982 --> 02:42:23,742
No, I'm not fucking
letting you near my kids!

3567
02:42:23,817 --> 02:42:26,058
You don't think I'm gonna see
my fucking kids again, huh?

3568
02:42:26,070 --> 02:42:27,617
Don't you fucking touch them!

3569
02:42:28,948 --> 02:42:30,746
Don't you fucking touch me!

3570
02:42:32,451 --> 02:42:35,705
Sweetheart? You're coming
on a trip with Daddy, all right?

3571
02:42:35,788 --> 02:42:37,756
You're coming on a trip with Daddy.

3572
02:42:40,501 --> 02:42:42,754
Don't you fucking touch her, Jordan.

3573
02:42:42,836 --> 02:42:45,589
I swear to God, I will fucking kill you!

3574
02:42:48,259 --> 02:42:49,511
It's all right, baby.

3575
02:42:49,593 --> 02:42:52,312
You and Daddy are gonna go
on a little trip together, okay?

3576
02:42:52,388 --> 02:42:53,935
- A little trip together.
- Violet!

3577
02:42:54,014 --> 02:42:55,106
Violet!

3578
02:42:55,182 --> 02:42:57,401
- Get the key! Get the key!
- I got it!

3579
02:42:57,476 --> 02:42:59,103
Jordan, you open this fucking door

3580
02:42:59,186 --> 02:43:01,985
- right now! Open the door!
- Put your seat belt on.

3581
02:43:02,064 --> 02:43:03,407
There you go. Get your legs in.

3582
02:43:03,482 --> 02:43:05,109
I'm taking her with me!

3583
02:43:05,192 --> 02:43:07,820
I told you I'm taking her with me,
you fucking bitch!

3584
02:43:07,903 --> 02:43:10,622
You're not gonna stop me!
You're not gonna stop me!

3585
02:43:11,407 --> 02:43:13,501
We're going on a little trip, honey.

3586
02:43:13,909 --> 02:43:15,411
No! No!

3587
02:43:16,036 --> 02:43:17,413
Get the hell out of here!

3588
02:43:17,496 --> 02:43:19,624
Leave that baby alone!

3589
02:43:19,707 --> 02:43:21,880
Violet! Garage door! Close it!

3590
02:43:21,959 --> 02:43:23,085
Mommy!

3591
02:43:23,210 --> 02:43:25,383
- Get out of here!
- Open the fucking door!

3592
02:43:26,297 --> 02:43:27,423
Mommy!

3593
02:43:30,467 --> 02:43:32,094
No!

3594
02:43:39,393 --> 02:43:42,146
Oh, Lord! Oh, my heavens...

3595
02:43:42,229 --> 02:43:43,526
Get the baby!

3596
02:43:43,605 --> 02:43:45,733
Naomi, get the baby!

3597
02:43:46,483 --> 02:43:48,156
- Mommy.
- Honey, it's okay.

3598
02:43:48,235 --> 02:43:49,487
It's gonna be okay.

3599
02:43:49,570 --> 02:43:51,572
Oh, Mr. Jordan has lost his mind.

3600
02:43:52,573 --> 02:43:54,371
- Baby...
- it's all right, honey.

3601
02:43:54,450 --> 02:43:56,043
She all right?

3602
02:43:56,118 --> 02:43:57,415
Is she all right?

3603
02:43:58,162 --> 02:43:59,755
What's the matter with you?

3604
02:43:59,997 --> 02:44:01,340
Is she all right?

3605
02:44:08,714 --> 02:44:10,091
Paragraph one.

3606
02:44:10,174 --> 02:44:11,676
The defendant shall plead guilty

3607
02:44:11,759 --> 02:44:15,184
to all counts of the indictment
currently pending against him

3608
02:44:15,262 --> 02:44:19,108
in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of New York.

3609
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:20,692
Paragraph two.

3610
02:44:20,768 --> 02:44:21,894
Talk normally.

3611
02:44:21,977 --> 02:44:25,197
The defendant shall participate
in undercover activities...

3612
02:44:25,272 --> 02:44:26,398
Breathe normally.

3613
02:44:26,482 --> 02:44:30,032
"Including wearing a recording device,
also known as a wire...

3614
02:44:30,110 --> 02:44:32,283
After five minutes,
you'll forget you even have it on.

3615
02:44:32,363 --> 02:44:33,489
In conjunction with the investigation...

3616
02:44:33,572 --> 02:44:35,119
Fucking brutal.

3617
02:44:35,240 --> 02:44:36,492
Quit your bitching.

3618
02:44:36,575 --> 02:44:38,418
Paragraph four.
The defendant must not commit,

3619
02:44:38,494 --> 02:44:40,667
or attempt to commit,
any further crimes.

3620
02:44:40,746 --> 02:44:44,216
Please. Let me just sign
the fucking thing already.

3621
02:44:44,291 --> 02:44:45,668
Thank you.

3622
02:44:48,629 --> 02:44:49,801
Just here?

3623
02:44:49,880 --> 02:44:51,427
That'd be good.

3624
02:44:53,133 --> 02:44:54,259
Thank you.

3625
02:44:54,343 --> 02:44:55,970
It wasn't even a choice.

3626
02:44:57,012 --> 02:45:00,016
For the next six hours,
I came up with a list.

3627
02:45:00,307 --> 02:45:03,231
Friends, enemies, business associates.

3628
02:45:03,310 --> 02:45:07,406
Anybody who'd ever known me
or taken so much as a stock tip.

3629
02:45:12,945 --> 02:45:15,243
Wolfie! Wolfie! Wolfie!

3630
02:45:17,032 --> 02:45:19,831
The first name on the list was Donnie.

3631
02:45:22,204 --> 02:45:25,333
Jordan, do you know how good it is
to have you back in this office?

3632
02:45:25,707 --> 02:45:27,755
It's not the same when you're gone.

3633
02:45:27,835 --> 02:45:29,587
It's sad, you understand? It's like...

3634
02:45:29,670 --> 02:45:31,092
That fucking Steve Madden, huh?

3635
02:45:31,171 --> 02:45:32,343
I can't...

3636
02:45:32,423 --> 02:45:34,266
Swear to God, I can't even think about it.

3637
02:45:34,341 --> 02:45:36,218
Every time I think about him,
my blood boils.

3638
02:45:36,301 --> 02:45:37,974
I can't even say his name.

3639
02:45:38,053 --> 02:45:39,600
- I know.
- It's, like, disgusting.

3640
02:45:39,680 --> 02:45:42,058
I grew up with this guy
and he betrays me like that.

3641
02:45:43,350 --> 02:45:46,274
He ever get back to you about that...

3642
02:45:47,020 --> 02:45:48,772
About that account?

3643
02:45:54,611 --> 02:45:55,658
You remember.

3644
02:45:55,737 --> 02:45:57,739
It was like four or five mil,
something like that, right?

3645
02:45:57,823 --> 02:46:00,952
He was supposed
to kick back four or five mil, was it?

3646
02:46:05,372 --> 02:46:06,840
Actually, I was...

3647
02:46:06,915 --> 02:46:08,292
I was fucked up, Jordan,

3648
02:46:08,375 --> 02:46:09,877
- so I don't really remember.
- Yeah.

3649
02:46:09,960 --> 02:46:11,962
Yeah, right. Stupid.

3650
02:46:12,629 --> 02:46:16,634
Well, if he calls you,
you make sure and contact me, okay?

3651
02:46:18,469 --> 02:46:20,142
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah.

3652
02:46:20,220 --> 02:46:22,314
Of course, yeah. No, of course.

3653
02:46:25,726 --> 02:46:28,229
You gonna eat
that last piece of yellowtail, bud?

3654
02:46:29,271 --> 02:46:31,023
No, it's all yours.

3655
02:46:31,857 --> 02:46:33,200
Can I get this?

3656
02:46:35,694 --> 02:46:37,412
So, what else is...

3657
02:46:40,157 --> 02:46:42,159
Well, how's Naomi and everything?

3658
02:46:42,242 --> 02:46:43,664
You know how it is.

3659
02:46:43,744 --> 02:46:45,838
She hates my fucking guts.

3660
02:46:47,581 --> 02:46:49,254
How's Hildy? Good?

3661
02:46:50,083 --> 02:46:53,678
She's still alive,
so my life is fucked, you know?

3662
02:46:53,754 --> 02:46:54,926
Yeah.

3663
02:47:01,762 --> 02:47:03,264
Mr. Jordan.

3664
02:47:04,932 --> 02:47:07,105
Mr. Jordan, you got a visitor.

3665
02:47:07,476 --> 02:47:08,523
What?

3666
02:47:08,977 --> 02:47:10,775
You've got a visitor.

3667
02:47:26,286 --> 02:47:28,288
I need you to get dressed.

3668
02:47:28,372 --> 02:47:30,591
Why? What the fuck's going on?

3669
02:47:35,629 --> 02:47:37,427
You're going to jail.

3670
02:47:49,351 --> 02:47:50,568
All right.

3671
02:47:50,644 --> 02:47:52,237
I'll get some clothes on.

3672
02:47:52,312 --> 02:47:54,656
We'll give you a hand with that.

3673
02:48:03,240 --> 02:48:04,332
Okay.

3674
02:48:16,545 --> 02:48:17,797
FBI!

3675
02:48:18,213 --> 02:48:21,808
Everybody sit down. Put your hands
where they can be seen, and shut up!

3676
02:48:21,883 --> 02:48:23,601
Don't you fucking touch me.

3677
02:48:23,677 --> 02:48:25,805
Get your fucking hands off me!

3678
02:48:25,887 --> 02:48:27,639
Don't get out of your seats!

3679
02:48:40,861 --> 02:48:42,488
It's fucking Chanel!

3680
02:48:55,125 --> 02:48:57,219
I gave up everyone.

3681
02:48:57,377 --> 02:48:58,879
And in return,

3682
02:48:58,962 --> 02:49:03,342
I got three years in some hellhole
in Nevada I'd never even heard of.

3683
02:49:05,218 --> 02:49:07,596
Like my pops, Mad Max, had said,

3684
02:49:08,388 --> 02:49:10,982
"The chickens had come home to roost.“

3685
02:49:12,392 --> 02:49:14,611
Whatever the fuck that means.

3686
02:49:18,190 --> 02:49:19,487
I hope Your Honor would agree

3687
02:49:19,566 --> 02:49:21,568
that Mr. Belfort
has distinguished himself

3688
02:49:21,652 --> 02:49:23,746
in terms of his cooperation.

3689
02:49:23,820 --> 02:49:25,900
Mr. Belfort has helped
the government win convictions

3690
02:49:25,947 --> 02:49:28,496
of over two dozen serious offenders

3691
02:49:29,743 --> 02:49:31,666
and helped them
recover millions of dollars

3692
02:49:31,745 --> 02:49:35,170
to be made available
for restitution to their victims.

3693
02:49:37,417 --> 02:49:41,092
The sentence of the court shall be
36 months in federal prison.

3694
02:49:42,923 --> 02:49:45,051
Please remand the defendant.

3695
02:49:47,260 --> 02:49:48,978
I'm sorry.

3696
02:49:51,890 --> 02:49:52,937
That's okay.

3697
02:50:41,314 --> 02:50:43,737
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

3698
02:50:43,817 --> 02:50:45,660
When we arrived at the prison,

3699
02:50:45,736 --> 02:50:47,909
I was absolutely terrified.

3700
02:50:48,697 --> 02:50:50,074
Belfort, on your feet.

3701
02:50:50,157 --> 02:50:52,455
But I needn't have been.

3702
02:50:52,659 --> 02:50:55,287
You see, for a brief fleeting moment,

3703
02:50:55,996 --> 02:50:58,044
I'd forgotten I was rich.

3704
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:02,510
And I lived in a place
where everything was for sale.

3705
02:51:05,005 --> 02:51:07,724
Wouldn't you like to learn how to sell it?

3706
02:51:07,799 --> 02:51:10,678
So listen. I've met some
bad motherfuckers in my life.

3707
02:51:10,761 --> 02:51:14,231
I'm talking about rock stars,
professional athletes, gangsters.

3708
02:51:14,306 --> 02:51:16,104
I'm telling you,
some real bad motherfuckers.

3709
02:51:16,183 --> 02:51:18,481
But this guy, my good friend,

3710
02:51:18,560 --> 02:51:21,313
Mr. Jordan Belfort, is the single

3711
02:51:21,396 --> 02:51:24,195
baddest motherfucker I have ever met.

3712
02:51:24,733 --> 02:51:26,451
So I want you right now

3713
02:51:26,526 --> 02:51:29,655
to give a warm Auckland,
New Zealand welcome

3714
02:51:29,738 --> 02:51:34,118
for my good friend
and the world's greatest sales trainer,

3715
02:51:34,201 --> 02:51:36,454
Mr. Jordan Belfort!

3716
02:51:47,422 --> 02:51:48,719
Thank you.

3717
02:52:11,696 --> 02:52:13,414
Sell me this pen.

3718
02:52:17,994 --> 02:52:20,042
It's...

3719
02:52:20,330 --> 02:52:22,082
It's an amazing pen.

3720
02:52:22,415 --> 02:52:24,588
For professionals, it's a...

3721
02:52:27,712 --> 02:52:29,430
Sell me this pen.

3722
02:52:30,423 --> 02:52:31,640
Well, it's a nice pen.

3723
02:52:31,716 --> 02:52:33,013
You can use the pen

3724
02:52:33,093 --> 02:52:36,313
to write down thoughts
from your life so you can...

3725
02:52:38,098 --> 02:52:41,443
Sell me this pen.

3726
02:52:43,436 --> 02:52:44,653
Well...

3727
02:52:45,021 --> 02:52:48,616
This pen works
and I personally love this pen...
